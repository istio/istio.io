Istio's initial 0.1 release was in May of 2017. The 0.1 release was to
get early feedback and provide a glimpse into what we're planning.

Istio's second release, 0.2, was in October of 2017. The 0.2 release provides a much enhanced developer experience and a number of exciting new features.

See our [roadmap]({{home}}/docs/reference/release-roadmap.html) and [release notes]({{home}}/docs/reference/release-notes.html) for more details.
