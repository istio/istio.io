Yes. The key and certificate distribution in Istio Auth is based on [Kubernetes secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

Secrets have known [security risks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks). The Kubernetes team is working on
[several features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2y-9geg9EfHHtCDYTXptCa-F4kQ0RyiH-c_M1SyD0s) to improve
Kubernetes secret security, from secret encryption to node-level access control. And as of version 1.6, Kubernetes introduces
[RBAC authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/), which can provide fine-grained secrets management.
