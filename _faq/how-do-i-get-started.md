We recommend starting with the [BookInfo]({{home}}/docs/samples/bookinfo.html) sample, which walks through setting up a cluster with 
four distinct 
microservices managed by Istio. It exercises some basic features, including content-based routing, fault injection, and rate-limiting.

After you have mastered the BookInfo sample, you are ready to begin using Istio for your own services. To start using Istio on your existing Kubernetes 
cluster, please refer to our [Installation]({{home}}/docs/tasks/installing-istio.html) task guide.
