      # We have a cache of URLs to help improve the chances of htmlproofer not hitting a timeout
      # when probing links for validity. Alas, this cache is only for a given pull request due to
      # the key. Ideally, this key would be using today's date as part of the key instead, such that
      # a single daily build would need to update the cache, and it would then it reused for the
      # subsequent builds for that day. Alas, I can't figure out how to get the current date and use it
      # as a component of the key.
