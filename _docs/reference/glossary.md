<!-- Ideas for words to add to the glossary

Service instance

Service version

Source - ?

Destination -- a fully-qualified hostname, some tags, a Load balancing policy, a Circuit breaker policy,
a Timeout policy, a Retry policy, a L7 fault injection policy, a L4 fault injection policy, and
"Custom policy implementations"

RouteRule - destination, MatchCondition, 0..N DestinationWeights, precedence

ProxyMeshConfig -- nothing

Load balancing policy -- ROUND_ROBIN|LEAST_CONN|RANDOM|Any

Circuit breaker policy -- Currently a bunch of threshold parameters, with a work item to support all Envoy capabilities

Timeout policy -- seconds (a double), plus a feature to let downstream service specify via a header (!?!), plus "custom"

Retry policy -- # of attempts, plus a feature to let downstream service specify via a header (!?!), plus "custom"

L7 fault injection policy -- Delay fault, Abort fault, plus some tags to trigger them on specific header patterns

L4 fault injection policy -- bandwidth Throttle, TCP terminate connection

MatchCondition -- source, (source) tags, TCP L4MatchAttributes, UDP L4MatchAttributes, "Set of HTTP match conditions"

DestinationWeight -- fully-qualified destination, tags, and weight (the sum of weights "across destination" should add up to 100). (Or do we mean RFC 2119 style "SHOULD" for "should)?

L4MatchAttributes just 0..N source and destination subnet strings, of the forms a.b.c.d and a.b.c.d/xx

HTTP match conditions -- This seems to be HTTP and gRPC headers ... the examples given are "uri", "scheme", "authority", and we
match them case-insensitive, and using exact|prefix|regexp format

Delay fault -- fixed or exponential delay. Fixed has a duration plus a % of requests to delay. Exponential has a "mean" (that I don't understand)

Abort fault -- A type plus % of requests to abort. The types are only HTTP, HTTP/2, gRPC. No TCP resets or TLS (?!?)

# Glossary

- **Envoy**.
Envoy is the high-performance proxy that Istio uses to mediate all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. 
Learn more about Envoy [here](https://lyft.github.io/envoy/).

- **Istio-Auth**.
Istio-Auth provides strong service-to-service and end-user authentication using mutual TLS, with built-in identity and
credential management. Learn more about Istio-Auth *TBD*.
                    
- **Istio-Manager**.
Istio-Manager serves as an interface between the user and Istio, collecting and validating configuration and propagating it to the
various Istio components. It abstracts environment-specific implementation details from Mixer and Envoy, providing them with an
abstract representation of the userâ€™s services 
that is independent of the underlying platform.
                    
- **Microservice**.
A lightweight service.
                    
- **Mixer**.
Mixer is an Istio component responsible for enforcing access control and usage policies across the service mesh and collecting telemetry data
from the Envoy proxy and other services. Learn more about Mixer [here](/docs/concepts/policy-and-control/mixer.html).

- **Service**.
A well-known IP endpoint and port that implements a specific protocol.

- **Service Consumer**.
The agent that is using a service.

- **Service Mesh**.
A collection of services interconnected through Istio's fleet of proxies.

- **Service Operator**.
The agent that deploys and manages a service by manipulating configuration state and
monitoring health via a variety of dashboards.

- **Service Producer**.
The agent that creates a service by writing source code.
