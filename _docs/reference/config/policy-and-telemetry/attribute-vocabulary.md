Attributes are a central concept used throughout Istio. You can find a description of what attributes are
and what they are used for [here]({{home}}/docs/concepts/policies-and-telemetry/config.html#attributes).

A given Istio deployment has a fixed vocabulary of attributes that it understands. The specific vocabulary is
determined by the set of attribute producers being used in the deployment. The primary attribute producer in Istio
is Envoy, although Mixer and services can also introduce attributes.

The table below shows the set of canonical attributes and their respective types. Most Istio
deployments will have agents (Envoy or Mixer adapters) that produce these attributes.

| destination.labels | map[string, string] | A map of key-value pairs attached to the server instance. | version => v2 |
| destination.user | string | The user running the destination application. | service-account |
| request.headers | map[string, string] | HTTP request headers. For gRPC, its metadata will be here. | |
| request.id | string | An ID for the request with statistically low probability of collision. | |
| request.path | string | The HTTP URL path including query string | |
| request.host | string | HTTP/1.x host header or HTTP/2 authority header. | redis-master:3337 |
| request.method | string | The HTTP method. | |

| request.referer | string | The HTTP referer header. | |
| request.scheme | string | URI Scheme of the request | |
| request.size | int64 | Size of the request in bytes. For HTTP requests this is equivalent to the Content-Length header. | |
| `request.total_size` | int64 | Total size of HTTP request in bytes, including request headers, body and trailers. | |
| request.time | timestamp | The timestamp when the destination receives the request. This should be equivalent to Firebase "now". | |

| context.protocol | string | Protocol of the request or connection being proxied. | tcp |
| context.time | timestamp | The timestamp of Mixer operation. | |
| api.service | string | The public service name. This is different than the in-mesh service identity and reflects the name of the service exposed to the client. | my-svc.com |
| api.version | string | The API version. | v1alpha1 |
| api.operation | string | Unique string used to identify the operation. The id is unique among all operations described in a specific <service, version>. | getPetsById |
| api.protocol | string | The protocol type of the API call. Mainly for monitoring/analytics. Note that this is the frontend protocol exposed to the client, not the protocol implemented by the backend service. | "http", “https”, or "grpc" |
| request.auth.principal | string | The authenticated principal of the request. This is a string of the issuer (`iss`) and subject (`sub`) claims within a JWT concatenated with “/” with a percent-encoded subject value.
