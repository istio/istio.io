This task shows how to install Istio in a non-kubernetes environment, where
Consul handles service registration. Unlike Kubernetes installation, there
is no one-stop installation script since there are several combinations of
the container orchestration platforms with Consul. For the purposes of
illustration, we focus on a simple Docker-based cluster with Consul.

_This document is under construction._

Describe control plane installation, integration options.
