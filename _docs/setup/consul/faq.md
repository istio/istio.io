* _My application isn't working, where can I troubleshoot this?_

  Please ensure all required containers are running: etcd, istio-apiserver, consul, registrator, pilot.  If one of them is not running, you may find the {containerID} using `docker ps -a` and then use `docker logs {containerID}` to read the logs.   
  
* _How do I unset the context changed by istioctl at the end?_

  Your ```kubectl``` is switched to use the istio context at the end of the `istio context-create` command.  You can use ```kubectl config get-contexts``` to obtain the list of contexts and ```kubectl config use-context {desired-context}``` to switch to use your desired context.
