This task shows how to install Istio in a non-kubernetes machine in the same network
(VPC, VPN) as the kubernetes cluster.

_This document is under construction._

## Prerequisites

* The machine must have IP connectivity to the nodes and endpoints in the cluster. This
typically requires same VPC or a VPN connection, as well as a container network that
provides direct (without NAT or firewall deny) routing to the endpoints. The machine
is not required to have access to the cluster IP addresses assigned by K8S.

* The control plane (Pilot, Mixer, CA) and kuberentes DNS server must be accessible
from the VM. This is typically done using an [Internal Load
Balancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#internal-load-balancer).

## Installation steps

Setup consists of preparing the cluster for extensions and installing and configuring each VM.

Example functions to help with the cluster setup are available in
[istio_vm_common.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/master/install/tools/istio_vm_common.sh).
Depending on cluster and environment you may need to adjust them for your cluster and VM.
The scripts need to be run by a cluster admin, with permissions to kubernetes and the VM.

An example script to configure a machine is available in [istio_vm_setup.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/master/install/tools/istio_vm_setup.sh).
You should customize it to match your normal provisioning toos and DNS requirements.

### Preparing the K8s cluster

* Setup internal load balancers for Kube DNS, Pilot, Mixer and CA. This step is specific to
each cluster - the istioInitILB function has an example for GKE using internal load balancers.
This step should result in IP addresses accessible from the VM and allowing direct access
to the components above.

* Generate the Istio 'cluster.env' config to be deployed in the VMs. This file contains
the cluster IP address ranges to intercept.

Example generated files:

   ```bash

   # See istioGenerateClusterConfig in istio_vm_common.sh
   cat /usr/local/istio/proxy/cluster.env
   ISTIO_SERVICE_CIDR=10.23.240.0/20

  ```
* Generate DNS config file to be used in the VMs. This will allow apps on the VM to resolve
cluster service names, which will be intercepted by the sidecar and forwarded.

Example generated files:
   ```bash

   # See istioGenerateClusterConfig in istio_vm_common.sh
   cat /etc/dnsmasq/kubedns
   server=/svc.cluster.local/10.128.0.6
   address=/istio-mixer/10.128.0.7
   address=/mixer-server/10.128.0.7
   address=/istio-pilot/10.128.0.5
   address=/istio-ca/10.128.0.8

  ```

### Setting up the machines

* Copy the config files and istio debian files to each machine joining the cluster.

* Configure and verify DNS settings - this may require installing dnsmasq, adding it to
/etc/resolv.conf directly or via DHCP scripts.  To verify, check that the VM can resolve
names and connect to pilot, for example:

    ```bash

    # Example
    dig ...
    curl ...
    ```

* If auth is enabled, extract the initial kubernetes secrets and copy them to the machine.
An example in 'istio_provision_cert' - the generated files must be copied to /etc/certs on
each machine.

* Install istio debian files and start 'istio' and 'istio-auth-node-agent' services.


After setup, the machine should be able to access services running in the k8s cluster
or other cluster extension machines.


## Running services on a cluster extension machine

* Configure the sidecar to intercept the port. This is configured in /var/lib/istio/envoy/sidecar.env,
using the ISTIO_INBOUND_PORTS environment variable.

  Example (on the VM running the service):

   ```bash

   echo "ISTIO_INBOUND_PORTS=27017,8080" > /var/lib/istio/envoy/sidecar.env
   systemctl restart istio
   ```

* Manually configure a selector-less service and endpoints. The 'selector-less' service is used for
services that are not backed by Kubernetes pods.

   Example, on a machine with permissions to modify k8s services:
   ```bash

   istioctl register ...

   ```

After the setup, k8s pods and other cluster extensions should be able to access the
services running on the machine.
