## General

This release has only got a few weeks worth of changes, as we stabilize our monthly release process. 
In addition to the usual pile of bug fixes and perf improvements, this release includes:

- **Cloud Foundry**. Added support for the [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org) platform to Pilot, making it
possible for Pilot to discover CF services and service instances. This represents the strict minimum needed to
get things running, additional work remains in this area to flesh things out.

- **Circonus**. Mixer now includes an adapter for the [Circonus](https://www.circonus.com) analytics and monitoring platform.

- **Pilot Metrics**. Pilot now collects metrics for diagnostics.

- **Helm Charts**. We now provide helm charts to install Istio. [DOC LINK?]

- **Enhanced Attribute Expressions**. Mixer's expression language gained a few new functions. [DOC LINK?]

If you're into the nitty-gritty details, you can see our more detailed low-level
