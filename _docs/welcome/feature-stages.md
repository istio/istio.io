We have made changes to Istio's release model. Starting with 0.3.0, releases will be delivered on a monthly cadence. Going forward, 
you can expect a new release towards the end of every month. You can download the current version by visiting our
[release page](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases).

Each individual feature will go through the Alpha, Beta, and Stable phases. Please note that the phases are applied to individual features
within the product, not to the product as a whole. Here is a high level description of what these labels means:

## Feature Phase Definition

|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------
|   **Purpose**         | Demo-able, works end-to-end but has limitations     | Usable in production, not a toy anymore         | Dependable, production hardened      
|   **API**         | No guarantees on backward compatibility    | APIs are versioned         | Dependable, production worthy. APIs are versioned, with automated version conversion for backward compatibility

|   **Deprecation Policy**        | None     | Weak - 3 months         | Dependable,  Firm 1 year
