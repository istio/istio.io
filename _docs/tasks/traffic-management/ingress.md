This task describes how to configure Istio to expose a service outside of the service mesh cluster.
In a Kubernetes environment, the [Kubernetes Ingress Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
allows users to specify services that should be exposed outside the
cluster. However, the Ingress Resource specification is very minimal,
allowing users to specify just hosts, paths and their backing services.
The following are the known limitations of Istio ingress:

1. Istio supports standard Kubernetes Ingress specification without
   annotations. There is no support for `ingress.kubernetes.io` annotations
   in the Ingress resource specifications. Any annotation other than
   `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: istio` will be ignored.
2. Regular expressions in paths are not supported.
3. Fault injection at the Ingress is not supported.

## Before you begin

* Setup Istio by following the instructions in the
  [Installation guide]({{home}}/docs/setup/).
  
* Make sure your current directory is the `istio` directory.
  
* Start the [httpbin](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/httpbin) sample,
  which will be used as the destination service to be exposed externally.

  If you installed the [Istio-Initializer]({{home}}/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection.html#automatic-sidecar-injection), do

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml
  ```

  Without the Istio-Initializer:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml)
  ```

## Configuring ingress (HTTP)

1. Create a basic Ingress Resource for the httpbin service

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: simple-ingress
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: istio
   spec:
     rules:
     - http:
         paths:
         - path: /status/.*
           backend:
             serviceName: httpbin
             servicePort: 8000
   EOF
   ```
 
   `/.*` is a special Istio notation that is used to indicate a prefix
   match, specifically a
   [rule match configuration]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/traffic-rules/routing-rules.html#matchcondition)
   of the form (`prefix: /`).
   
## Verifying ingress

1. Determine the ingress URL:

   * If your cluster is running in an environment that supports external load balancers,
     use the ingress' external address:

     ```bash
     kubectl get ingress simple-ingress -o wide
     ```
   
     ```bash
     NAME             HOSTS     ADDRESS                 PORTS     AGE
     simple-ingress   *         130.211.10.121          80        1d
     ```

     ```bash
     export INGRESS_HOST=130.211.10.121
     ```

   * If load balancers are not supported, use the ingress controller pod's hostIP:
   
     ```bash
     kubectl -n istio-system get po -l istio=ingress -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.hostIP}'
     ```

     ```bash
     169.47.243.100
     ```

     along with the istio-ingress service's nodePort for port 80:
   
     ```bash
     kubectl -n istio-system get svc istio-ingress
     ```
   
     ```bash
     NAME            CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
     istio-ingress   10.10.10.155   <pending>     80:31486/TCP,443:32254/TCP   32m
     ```
   
     ```bash
     export INGRESS_HOST=169.47.243.100:31486
     ```
   
1. Access the httpbin service using _curl_:

   ```bash
   curl -I http://$INGRESS_HOST/status/200
   ```

   ```bash
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Server: meinheld/0.6.1
   Date: Thu, 05 Oct 2017 21:23:17 GMT
   Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
   X-Powered-By: Flask
   X-Processed-Time: 0.00105214118958
   Content-Length: 0
   Via: 1.1 vegur
   Connection: Keep-Alive
   ```

1. Access any other URL that has not been explicitly exposed. You should
   see a HTTP 403

   ```bash
   curl -I http://$INGRESS_HOST/headers
   ```

   ```bash
   HTTP/1.1 403 FORBIDDEN
   Server: meinheld/0.6.1
   Date: Thu, 05 Oct 2017 21:24:47 GMT
   Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
   X-Powered-By: Flask
   X-Processed-Time: 0.000759840011597
   Content-Length: 0
   Via: 1.1 vegur
   Connection: Keep-Alive
   ```

## Configuring secure ingress (HTTPS)

1. Generate keys if necessary

   A private key and certificate can be created for testing using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /tmp/tls.key -out /tmp/tls.crt -subj "/CN=foo.bar.com"
   ```

1. Update the secret using `kubectl`

   ```bash
   kubectl create -n istio-system secret tls istio-ingress-certs --key /tmp/tls.key --cert /tmp/tls.crt
   ```

1. Create the Ingress Resource for the httpbin service

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: secure-ingress
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: istio
   spec:
     tls:
       - secretName: istio-ingress-certs # currently ignored
     rules:
     - http:
         paths:
         - path: /status/.*
           backend:
             serviceName: httpbin
             servicePort: 8000
         - path: /delay/.*
           backend:
             serviceName: httpbin
             servicePort: 8000
   EOF
   ```

   Set the INGRESS_HOST to point to the ip address and the
   port number of the ingress service as shown earlier.

   > Note: Envoy currently only allows a single TLS secret in the ingress
   > since SNI is not yet supported. That means that the secret name field
   > in ingress resource is not used, and the secret must be called
   > `istio-ingress-certs` in `istio-system` namespace.

    
1. Access the secured httpbin service using _curl_:

   ```bash
   curl -I -k https://$INGRESS_HOST/status/200
   ```

## Using Istio Routing Rules with Ingress

Istio's routing rules can be used to achieve a greater degree of control
when routing requests to backend services. For example, the following
route rule sets a 4s timeout for all calls to the httpbin service on the
/delay URL.

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | istioctl create -f -
   apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
   kind: RouteRule
   metadata:
     name: status-route
   spec:
     destination:
       name: httpbin
     match:
       # Optionally limit this rule to istio ingress pods only
       source:
         name: istio-ingress
         labels:
           istio: ingress
       request:
         headers:
           uri:
             prefix: /delay/ #must match the path specified in ingress spec
                 # if using prefix paths (/delay/.*), omit the .*.
                 # if using exact match, use exact: /status
     route:
     - weight: 100
     httpReqTimeout:
       simpleTimeout:
         timeout: 4s
  EOF
   ```

If you were to make a call to the ingress with the URL
`http://$INGRESS_HOST/delay/10`, you will find that the call returns in 4s
instead of the expected 10s delay.

You can use other features of the route rules such as redirects, rewrites,
routing to multiple versions, regular expression based match in HTTP
headers, websocket upgrades, timeouts, retries, etc. Please refer to the
[routing rules]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/traffic-rules/routing-rules.html)
for more details.

> Note 1: Fault injection does not work at the Ingress

> Note 2: When matching requests in the routing rule, use the same exact
> path or prefix as the one used in the Ingress specification.

## Understanding ingresses

Ingresses provide gateways for external traffic to enter the Istio service
mesh and make the traffic management and policy features of Istio available
for edge services.

The servicePort field in the Ingress specification can take a port number
(integer) or a name. The port name must follow the Istio port naming
conventions (e.g., `grpc-*`, `http2-*`, `http-*`, etc.) in order to
function properly. The name used must match the port name in the backend
service declaration.

In the preceding steps we created a service inside the Istio service mesh
and showed how to expose both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints of the service to
external traffic. We also showed how to control the ingress traffic using
an Istio route rule.

## Cleanup

1. Remove the secret and Ingress Resource definitions.
    
   ```bash
   kubectl delete ingress simple-ingress secure-ingress 
   kubectl delete -n istio-system secret istio-ingress-certs
   ```

1. Shutdown the [httpbin](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/httpbin) service.

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml
   ```
