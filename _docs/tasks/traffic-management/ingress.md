> Note: This task uses the new [v1alpha3 traffic management API]({{home}}/blog/2018/v1alpha3-routing.html). The old API has been deprecated and will be removed in the next Istio release. If you need to use the old version, follow the docs [here](https://archive.istio.io/v0.6/docs/tasks/).

In a Kubernetes environment, the [Kubernetes Ingress Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
allows users to specify services that should be exposed outside the cluster.
For traffic entering an Istio service mesh, however, an Istio-aware [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-controllers)
is needed to allow Istio features, for example, monitoring and route rules, to be applied to traffic entering the cluster.

Istio provides an envoy-based ingress controller that implements very limited support for standard Kubernetes `Ingress` resources
as well as full support for an alternative specification,
[Istio Gateway]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/istio.networking.v1alpha3.html#Gateway).
Using a `Gateway` is the recommended approach for configuring ingress traffic for Istio services.
It is significantly more functional, not to mention the only option for non-Kubernetes environments.

This task describes how to configure Istio to expose a service outside of the service mesh using either specification.

## Before you begin

* Setup Istio by following the instructions in the
  [Installation guide]({{home}}/docs/setup/).

* Make sure your current directory is the `istio` directory.

*   Start the [httpbin](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/httpbin) sample,
    which will be used as the destination service to be exposed externally.

    If you installed the [Istio-Initializer]({{home}}/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection.html#automatic-sidecar-injection), do

    ```command
    $ kubectl apply -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml
    ```

    Without the Istio-Initializer:

    ```command
    $ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml)
    ```

*   Generate a certificate and key that will be used to demonstrate a TLS-secured gateway

    A private key and certificate can be created for testing using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).

    ```command
    $ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /tmp/tls.key -out /tmp/tls.crt -subj "/CN=foo.bar.com"
    ```

## Configuring ingress using an Istio Gateway resource (recommended)

An [Istio Gateway]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/istio.networking.v1alpha3.html#Gateway) is the preferred
model for configuring ingress traffic in Istio.
An ingress `Gateway` describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh receiving incoming
HTTP/TCP connections.
It configures exposed ports, protocols, etc.,
but, unlike [Kubernetes Ingress Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/),
does not include any traffic routing configuration. Traffic routing for ingress traffic is instead configured
using Istio routing rules, exactly in the same was as for internal service requests.

### Configuring a Gateway

1.  Create an Istio `Gateway`

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | istioctl create -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      name: httpbin-gateway
    spec:
      selector:
        istio: ingressgateway # use istio default controller
      servers:
      - port:
          number: 80
          name: http
          protocol: HTTP
        hosts:
        - "*"
      - port:
          number: 443
          name: https
          protocol: HTTPS
        tls:
          mode: SIMPLE
          serverCertificate: /tmp/tls.crt
          privateKey: /tmp/tls.key
        hosts:
        - "*"
    EOF
    ```

    Notice that a single `Gateway` specification can configure multiple ports, a simple HTTP (port 80) and
    secure HTTPS (port 443) in our case.

1.  Configure routes for traffic entering via the `Gateway`

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | istioctl create -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: httpbin
    spec:
      hosts:
      - "*"
      gateways:
      - httpbin-gateway
      http:
      - match:
        - uri:
            prefix: /status
        - uri:
            prefix: /delay
        route:
        - destination:
            port:
              number: 8000
            host: httpbin
    EOF
    ```

    Here we've created a [virtual service]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/istio.networking.v1alpha3.html#VirtualService)
    configuration for the `httpbin` service, containing two route rules that allow traffic for paths `/status` and `/delay`.
    The [gateways]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/istio.networking.v1alpha3.html#VirtualService.gateways) list
    specifies that only requests through our `httpbin-gateway` are allowed.
    All other external requests will be rejected with a 404 response.

    Note that in this configuration internal requests from other services in the mesh are not subject to these rules,
    but instead will simply default to round-robin routing. To apply these (or other rules) to internal calls,
    we could add the special value `mesh` to the list of `gateways`.

### Verifying a Gateway

The proxy instances implementing a particular `Gateway` configuration can be specified using a
[selector]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/istio.networking.v1alpha3.html#Gateway.selector) field.
In our case, we have set the selector value to `istio: ingressgateway` to use the default
`istio-ingressgateway` controller. Therefore, to test our `Gateway` we will send requests to
the `istio-ingressgateway` service.

1.  Get the ingressgateway controller pod's hostIP:

    ```command
    $ kubectl -n istio-system get po -l istio=ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.hostIP}'
    169.47.243.100
    ```

1.  Get the istio-ingress service's nodePorts for port 80 and 443:

    ```command
    $ kubectl -n istio-system get svc istio-ingressgateway
    NAME                   CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
    istio-ingressgateway   10.10.10.155   <pending>     80:31486/TCP,443:32254/TCP   32m
    ```

    ```command
    $ export INGRESS_HOST=169.47.243.100:31486
    $ export SECURE_INGRESS_HOST=169.47.243.100:32254
    ```

1.  Access the httpbin service with either HTTP or HTTPS using _curl_:

    ```command
    $ curl -I http://$INGRESS_HOST/status/200
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    server: envoy
    date: Mon, 29 Jan 2018 04:45:49 GMT
    content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    access-control-allow-origin: *
    access-control-allow-credentials: true
    content-length: 0
    x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 48
    ```

    ```command
    $ curl -I -k https://$SECURE_INGRESS_HOST/status/200
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    server: envoy
    date: Mon, 29 Jan 2018 04:45:49 GMT
    content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    access-control-allow-origin: *
    access-control-allow-credentials: true
    content-length: 0
    x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 96
    ```

1.  Access any other URL that has not been explicitly exposed. You should
    see a HTTP 404 error:

    ```command
    $ curl -I http://$INGRESS_HOST/headers
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    date: Mon, 29 Jan 2018 04:45:49 GMT
    server: envoy
    content-length: 0
    ```

    ```command
    $ curl -I https://$SECURE_INGRESS_HOST/headers
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    date: Mon, 29 Jan 2018 04:45:49 GMT
    server: envoy
    content-length: 0
    ```

## Configuring ingress using a Kubernetes Ingress resource

An Istio `Ingress` specification is based on the standard [Kubernetes Ingress Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
specification, with the following differences:

1. Istio `Ingress` specification contains a `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: istio` annotation.

1. All other annotations are ignored.

1. Path syntax is [c++11 regex format](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript)

Note that `Ingress` traffic is not affected by routing rules configured for a backend
(i.e., an Istio `VirtualService` cannot be combined with an `Ingress` specification).
Traffic splitting, fault injection, mirroring, header match, etc., will not work for ingress traffic.
A `DestinationRule` associated with the backend service will, however, work as expected.

The `servicePort` field in the `Ingress` specification can take a port number
(integer) or a name. The port name must follow the Istio port naming
conventions (e.g., `grpc-*`, `http2-*`, `http-*`, etc.) in order to
function properly. The name used must match the port name in the backend
service declaration.

### Configuring simple Ingress

1.  Create a basic `Ingress` specification for the httpbin service

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: simple-ingress
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: istio
    spec:
      rules:
      - http:
          paths:
          - path: /status/*
            backend:
              serviceName: httpbin
              servicePort: 8000
          - path: /delay/*
            backend:
              serviceName: httpbin
              servicePort: 8000
    EOF
    ```

### Verifying simple Ingress

1.  Determine the ingress URL:

    *   If your cluster is running in an environment that supports external load balancers, use the ingress' external address:

        ```command
        $ kubectl get ingress simple-ingress -o wide
        NAME             HOSTS     ADDRESS                 PORTS     AGE
        simple-ingress   *         130.211.10.121          80        1d
        ```

        ```command
        $ export INGRESS_HOST=130.211.10.121
        ```

    *   If load balancers are not supported, use the ingress controller pod's hostIP:

        ```command
        $ kubectl -n istio-system get po -l istio=ingress -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.hostIP}'
        169.47.243.100
        ```

        along with the istio-ingress service's nodePort for port 80:

        ```command
        $ kubectl -n istio-system get svc istio-ingress
        NAME            CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
        istio-ingress   10.10.10.155   <pending>     80:31486/TCP,443:32254/TCP   32m
        ```

        ```command
        $ export INGRESS_HOST=169.47.243.100:31486
        ```

1.  Access the httpbin service using _curl_:

    ```command
    $ curl -I http://$INGRESS_HOST/status/200
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    server: envoy
    date: Mon, 29 Jan 2018 04:45:49 GMT
    content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    access-control-allow-origin: *
    access-control-allow-credentials: true
    content-length: 0
    x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 48
    ```

1.  Access any other URL that has not been explicitly exposed. You should
    see a HTTP 404 error

    ```command
    $ curl -I http://$INGRESS_HOST/headers
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    date: Mon, 29 Jan 2018 04:45:49 GMT
    server: envoy
    content-length: 0
    ```

### Configuring secure Ingress (HTTPS)

1.  Create a Kubernetes `Secret` to hold the key/cert

    Create the secret `istio-ingress-certs` in namespace `istio-system` using `kubectl`. The Istio ingress controller
    will automatically load the secret.

    > The secret MUST be called `istio-ingress-certs` in the `istio-system` namespace, or it will not
    be mounted and available to the Istio ingress controller.

    ```command
    $ kubectl create -n istio-system secret tls istio-ingress-certs --key /tmp/tls.key --cert /tmp/tls.crt
    ```

    Note that by default all service accounts in the `istio-system` namespace can access this ingress key/cert,
    which risks leaking the key/cert. You can change the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules to protect them.
    See (Link TBD) for details.

1.  Create the `Ingress` specification for the httpbin service

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: secure-ingress
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: istio
    spec:
      tls:
        - secretName: istio-ingress-certs # currently ignored
      rules:
      - http:
          paths:
          - path: /status/*
            backend:
              serviceName: httpbin
              servicePort: 8000
          - path: /delay/*
            backend:
              serviceName: httpbin
              servicePort: 8000
    EOF
    ```

    > Because SNI is not yet supported, Envoy currently only allows a single TLS secret in the ingress.
    > That means the secretName field in ingress resource is not used.

### Verifying secure Ingress

1.  Determine the ingress URL:

    *   If your cluster is running in an environment that supports external load balancers,
    use the ingress' external address:

        ```command
        $ kubectl get ingress secure-ingress -o wide
        NAME             HOSTS     ADDRESS                 PORTS     AGE
        secure-ingress   *         130.211.10.121          80        1d
        ```

        ```command
        $ export SECURE_INGRESS_HOST=130.211.10.121
        ```

    *   If load balancers are not supported, use the ingress controller pod's hostIP:

        ```command
        $ kubectl -n istio-system get po -l istio=ingress -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.hostIP}'
        169.47.243.100
        ```

        along with the istio-ingress service's nodePort for port 443:

        ```command
        $ kubectl -n istio-system get svc istio-ingress
        NAME            CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
        istio-ingress   10.10.10.155   <pending>     80:31486/TCP,443:32254/TCP   32m
        ```

        ```command
        $ export SECURE_INGRESS_HOST=169.47.243.100:32254
        ```

1.  Access the httpbin service using _curl_:

    ```command
    $ curl -I -k https://$SECURE_INGRESS_HOST/status/200
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    server: envoy
    date: Mon, 29 Jan 2018 04:45:49 GMT
    content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    access-control-allow-origin: *
    access-control-allow-credentials: true
    content-length: 0
    x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 96
    ```

1.  Access any other URL that has not been explicitly exposed. You should
    see a HTTP 404 error

    ```command
    $ curl -I -k https://$SECURE_INGRESS_HOST/headers
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    date: Mon, 29 Jan 2018 04:45:49 GMT
    server: envoy
    content-length: 0
    ```

## Understanding what happened

`Gateway` or `Ingress` configuration resources allow external traffic to enter the
Istio service mesh and make the traffic management and policy features of Istio
available for edge services.

In the preceding steps we created a service inside the Istio service mesh
and showed how to expose both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints of the service to
external traffic. Using an Istio `Gateway` provides significantly more functionality
and is recommended. Using a Kubernetes `Ingress`, however, is also supported
and may be especially useful when moving existing Kubernetes applications to Istio.

## Cleanup

1.  Remove the `Gateway` configuration.

    ```command
    $ kubectl delete gateway httpbin-gateway
    ```

1.  Remove the `Ingress` configuration.

    ```command
    $ kubectl delete ingress simple-ingress secure-ingress
    ```

1.  Remove the routing rule and secret.

    ```command
    $ istioctl delete virtualservice httpbin
    $ kubectl delete -n istio-system secret istio-ingress-certs
    ```

1.  Shutdown the [httpbin](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/httpbin) service.

    ```command
    $ kubectl delete -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml
    ```
