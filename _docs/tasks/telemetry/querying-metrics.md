This task shows you how to query for Istio Metrics using Prometheus. As part of
this task, you will use the web-based interface for querying metric values.

The [Bookinfo]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html) sample application is used as
the example application throughout this task.

## Before you begin

[Install Istio]({{home}}/docs/setup/) in your cluster and deploy an
application.

## Querying Istio Metrics

1. Verify that the prometheus service is running in your cluster (since 0.8 the
   prometheus setup is included in istio.yaml and istio-auth.yaml by default)

   In Kubernetes environments, execute the following command:

   ```command
   $ kubectl -n istio-system get svc prometheus
   NAME         CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
   prometheus   10.59.241.54   <none>        9090/TCP   2m
   ```

1. Send traffic to the mesh.

   For the Bookinfo sample, visit `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage` in your web
   browser or issue the following command:

   ```command
   $ curl http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
   ```

   > `$GATEWAY_URL` is the value set in the [Bookinfo]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html) guide.

1. Open the Prometheus UI.

   In Kubernetes environments, execute the following command:

   ```command
   $ kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=prometheus -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 9090:9090 &
   ```

   Visit [http://localhost:9090/graph](http://localhost:9090/graph) in your web browser.

1. Execute a Prometheus query.

   In the "Expression" input box at the top of the web page, enter the text:
   `istio_request_count`. Then, click the **Execute** button.

   The results will be similar to:

{% include image.html width="100%" ratio="39.36%"
    link="./img/prometheus_query_result.png"
    caption="Prometheus Query Result"
    %}

    Other queries to try:

    - Total count of all requests to `productpage` service:

      ```
      istio_request_count{destination_service="productpage.default.svc.cluster.local"}
      ```

    - Total count of all requests to `v3` of the `reviews` service:

      ```
      istio_request_count{destination_service="reviews.default.svc.cluster.local", destination_version="v3"}
      ```

      This query returns the current total count of all requests to the v3 of the reviews service.

    - Rate of requests over the past 5 minutes to all `productpage` services:

      ```
      rate(istio_request_count{destination_service=~"productpage.*", response_code="200"}[5m])
      ```

### About the Prometheus add-on

Mixer comes with a built-in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) adapter that
exposes an endpoint serving generated metric values. The Prometheus add-on is a
Prometheus server that comes preconfigured to scrape Mixer endpoints to collect
the exposed metrics. It provides a mechanism for persistent storage and querying
of Istio metrics.

The configured Prometheus add-on scrapes three endpoints:
1. *istio-mesh* (`istio-mixer.istio-system:42422`): all Mixer-generated mesh
   metrics.
1. *mixer* (`istio-mixer.istio-system:9093`): all Mixer-specific metrics. Used
   to monitor Mixer itself.
1. *envoy* (`istio-mixer.istio-system:9102`): raw stats generated by Envoy (and
   translated from statsd to prometheus).

For more on querying Prometheus, please read their [querying
docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/basics/).

## Cleanup

* Remove any `kubectl port-forward` processes that may still be running:

   ```command
   $ killall kubectl
   ```

* If you are not planning to explore any follow-on tasks, refer to the
  [Bookinfo cleanup]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html#cleanup) instructions
  to shutdown the application.

## What's next

* Refer to the [In-Depth Telemetry]({{home}}/docs/guides/telemetry.html) guide.
