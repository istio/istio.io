This page shows how to install and configure Istio in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

* The following instructions assume you have access to a Kubernetes cluster. To install Kubernetes locally, try [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/).

* If you are using [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine), please make sure you are using static client certificates before fetching cluster credentials:

  ```bash
  gcloud config set container/use_client_certificate True
  gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone <zone> --project <project-name>
  ```

* Please update `kubectl` to the latest version supported by your cluster.

* Ensure the `curl` command is present.

## Installing on an existing cluster

For the {{ site.data.istio.version }} release, Istio must be installed in the same Kubernetes namespace as the applications. Instructions below will deploy Istio in the
default namespace. They can be modified for deployment in a different namespace.

1. Download and extract the [istio installation files](https://github.com/istio/istio/archive/0.1.0.tar.gz), or
clone Istio's [GitHub](https://github.com/istio/istio) repository:

   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/istio/istio
   ```

2. Change directory to install/kubernetes:

   ```bash
   cd install/kubernetes
   ```

3. Determine if your cluster has [RBAC enabled](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/) and find out the RBAC api version by running this command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get clusterrole -o yaml | grep apiVersion
   ```
   * If the command displays an error, or does not display anything, it means the cluster does not support RBAC, and you can proceed to step 4.

   * If the command displays 'alpha' version, please apply istio-rbac-alpha.yaml configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f istio-rbac-alpha.yaml
   ```
    
   * If the command displays 'beta' version, please apply istio-rbac-beta.yaml configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f istio-rbac-beta.yaml
   ```

4. Install Istio's core components
   (Istio-Manager, Mixer, Ingress-Controller, and Istio CA if auth is enabled):

   **If you would like to disable Istio Auth**:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f istio.yaml
   ```

   **If you would like to enable Istio Auth** (For more information, please see
   [Istio Auth installation guide](./istio-auth.html)):

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f istio-auth.yaml
   ```

5. Source the Istio configuration file:

   ```bash
   source ../../istio.VERSION
   ```

6. Download one of the [`istioctl`]({{home}}/docs/reference/commands/istioctl.html) client binaries corresponding to your OS: `istioctl-osx`, `istioctl-win.exe`,
`istioctl-linux`, targeted at Mac, Windows or Linux users respectively. For example, run the following commands on a Mac system:

   ```bash
   curl ${ISTIOCTL_URL}/istioctl-osx > /usr/local/bin/istioctl
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/istioctl
   ```

   `istioctl` is needed to inject Envoy as a sidecar proxy. It also provides a convenient CLI for creating routing rules and policies.
   Note: If you already have a previously installed version of `istioctl`, make sure that
   it is compatible with the manager image used in `istio.yaml`.
   If in doubt, download again or add the `--tag` option when running `istioctl kube-inject`.
   Invoke `istioctl kube-inject --help` for more details.

7. Optional: to view metrics collected by Mixer, install [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), [Grafana](http://staging.grafana.org) or
ServiceGraph addons:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f addons/grafana.yaml
   kubectl apply -f addons/prometheus.yaml
   kubectl apply -f addons/servicegraph.yaml
   ```

   The Grafana addon provides a dashboard visualization of the metrics by Mixer to a Prometheus instance. Please install both the `prometheus.yaml` and 
   `grafana.yaml` addons to configure the Istio dashboard for use.

   The simplest way to access the Istio dashboard is to configure port-forwarding for the grafana service, as follows:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pod -l app=grafana -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 3000:3000
   ```

   Then open a web browser to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/db/istio-dashboard`.

   The dashboard at that location should look something like the following:

   ![Grafana Istio Dashboard](./img/grafana_dashboard.png)

   NOTE: In some deployment environments, it will be possible to access the dashboard directly (without the `kubectl port-forward` command). This is because 
   the default addon configuration requests an external IP address for the grafana service.

   When applicable, the external IP address for the grafana service can be retrieved via:

   ```bash
   kubectl get services grafana
   ```

   With the EXTERNAL-IP returned from that command, the Istio dashboard can be reached at `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:3000/dashboard/db/istio-dashboard`.

## Verifying the installation

1. Ensure the following Kubernetes services were deployed: "istio-manager", "istio-mixer", "istio-ingress", and "istio-egress".

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc
   ```
   ```bash
   NAME                       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)              AGE
   istio-egress               10.7.241.106   <none>          80/TCP               39m
   istio-ingress              10.83.241.84   35.184.70.168   80:30583/TCP         39m
   istio-manager              10.83.251.26   <none>          8080/TCP             39m
   istio-mixer                10.83.242.1    <none>          9091/TCP,42422/TCP   39m
   ```

   Note that if your cluster is running in an environment that does not support an external loadbalancer
   (e.g., minikube), the `EXTERNAL-IP` will say `<pending>` and you will need to access the
   application using the service NodePort instead.

2. Check the corresponding Kubernetes pods were deployed: "istio-manager-\*", "istio-mixer-\*", "istio-ingress-\*", "istio-egress-\*", and "istio-ca-\*" (if Istio Auth is enabled).

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   ```bash
   NAME                                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   istio-egress-597320923-0szj8               1/1       Running   0          49m
   istio-ingress-594763772-j7jbz              1/1       Running   0          49m
   istio-manager-373576132-p2t9k              1/1       Running   0          49m
   istio-mixer-1154414227-56q3z               1/1       Running   0          49m
   istio-ca-1726969296-9srv2                  1/1       Running   0          49m
   ```

## Deploy your application

You can now deploy your own application or one of the Istio sample applications,
for example [BookInfo]({{home}}/docs/samples/bookinfo.html). Note that the application should use HTTP/1.1
or HTTP/2.0 protocol for all its HTTP traffic.

When deploying the application,
use [kube-inject]({{home}}/docs/reference/commands/istioctl.html#istioctl-kube-inject.html) to automatically inject
Envoy containers in the pods running the services:

```bash
kubectl create -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f <your-app-spec>.yaml)
```

## Uninstalling

1. Change directory to install/kubernetes:

   ```bash
   cd install/kubernetes
   ```

2. Uninstall Istio:

   **If Istio has auth disabled:**

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f istio.yaml
   ```

   **If Istio has auth enabled:**

    ```bash
    kubectl delete -f istio-auth.yaml
    ```
2. If RBAC was installed, please uninstall it:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f istio-rbac-beta.yaml
   ```
   or

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f istio-rbac-alpha.yaml
   ```

2. Delete the istioctl client:

   ```bash
   rm /usr/local/bin/istioctl
   ```
