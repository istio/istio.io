* Can a service with Istio Auth enabled communicate with a service without
  Istio?

  Currently it is not well supported. But we do have plan to support this
  in the near future.

* Can I enable Istio Auth with some services while disable others in the
  same cluster?

  Currently we only support cluster-wise Auth enable/disable. It is a high
  priority action item for us to support per-service auth.

* How can I use Kubernetes liveness and readiness for service health check
  with Istio Auth enabled?

  If Istio Auth is enabled, http and tcp health check from kubelet will not
  work since they do not have Istio Auth issued certs. A workaround is to
  use command option for health check, e.g., one can install curl in the
  service pod and curl itself within the pod. The Istio team is actively
  working on a real solution.

* Can I access the Kubernetes API Server with Auth enabled?

  The Kubernetes API server does not support mutual TLS
  authentication. Hence, when Istio mTLS authentication is enabled, it is
  currently not possible to communicate from a pod with Istio sidecar to
  the Kubernetes API server.
