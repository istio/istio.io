This task shows how operators can plug existing certificate and key into Istio CA.

By default, the Istio CA generates self-signed CA certificate and key and uses them to sign the workload certificates.
The Istio CA can also use the operator-specified certificate and key to sign workload certificates.
This task demonstrates an example to plug certificate and key into the Istio CA.

## Before you begin

* Set up Istio on auth-enabled Kubernetes by following the instructions in the
  [quick start]({{home}}/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html).
  Note that authentication should be enabled at step 4 in the
  [installation steps]({{home}}/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html#installation-steps).

## Plugging in the existing CA certificate

Suppose we want to have Istio CA use the existing certificate `ca-cert.pem` and key `ca-key.pem`.
Furthermore, the certificate `ca-cert.pem` is signed by the root certificate `root-cert.pem`,
and we would like to use `root-cert.pem` as the root certificate for Istio workloads.

In this example, because the Istio CA certificate (`ca-cert.pem`) is not set as the workloads' root certificate (`root-cert.pem`),
the workload cannot validate the workload certificates directly from the root certificate.
The workload needs a `cert-chain.pem` file to specify the chain of trust,
which should include the certificates of all the intermediate CAs between the workloads and the root CA.
In this example, it only contains the Istio CA certificate, so `cert-chain.pem` is the same as `ca-cert.pem`.
Note that if your `ca-cert.pem` is the same as `root-cert.pem`, you can have an empty `cert-chain.pem` file.

Download the example files:
```bash
wget -P /tmp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/master/security/samples/plugin_ca_certs/ca-cert.pem
wget -P /tmp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/master/security/samples/plugin_ca_certs/ca-key.pem
wget -P /tmp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/master/security/samples/plugin_ca_certs/root-cert.pem
wget -P /tmp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/master/security/samples/plugin_ca_certs/cert-chain.pem
```

The following steps enable plugging in the certificate and key into the Istio CA:
1. Create a secret `cacert` including all the input files `ca-cert.pem`, `ca-key.pem`, `root-cert.pem` and `cert-chain.pem`:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic cacerts -n istio-system --from-file=/tmp/ca-cert.pem --from-file=/tmp/ca-key.pem \
   --from-file=/tmp/root-cert.pem --from-file=/tmp/cert-chain.pem
   ```

1. Redeploy the Istio CA, which reads the certificates and key from the secret-mount files:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-ca-plugin-certs.yaml
   ```

1. To make sure the workloads obtain the new certificates promptly,
   delete the secrets generated by Istio CA (named as istio.*).
   In this example, `istio.default`. The Istio CA will issue new certificates for the workloads.
   ```bash
   kubectl delete secret istio.default
   ```
Note that if you are using different certificate/key file or secret names,
you need to change corresponding arguments in `istio-ca-plugin-certs.yaml`.

## Cleanup

* To remove the secret `cacerts`:

  ```bash
  kubectl delete secret cacerts -n istio-system
  ```

* To remove the Istio components:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete -f install/kubernetes/istio-auth.yaml
  ```
