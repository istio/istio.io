This task shows how to control access to a service using the Kubernetes labels.

## Before you begin

* Set up Istio on Kubernetes by following the instructions in the
  [Installation guide]({{home}}/docs/setup/kubernetes/).

* Deploy the [BookInfo]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html) sample application.

* Initialize the application version routing to direct `reviews` service requests from
  test user "jason" to version v2 and requests from any other user to v3.

  ```bash
  istioctl create -f samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-test-v2.yaml
  istioctl create -f samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-v3.yaml
  ```
  
  > Note: if you have conflicting rules that you set in previous tasks,
    use `istioctl replace` instead of `istioctl create`.

  > Note: if you are using a namespace other than `default`,
    use `istioctl -n namespace ...` to specify the namespace.

## Access control using _denials_ 

Using Istio you can control access to a service based on any attributes that are available within Mixer.
This simple form of access control is based on conditionally denying requests using Mixer selectors.

Consider the [BookInfo]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html) sample application where the `ratings` service is accessed by multiple versions
of the `reviews` service. We would like to cut off access to version `v3` of the `reviews` service.

1. Point your browser at the BookInfo `productpage` (http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage). 

   If you log in as user "jason", you should see black rating stars with each review,
   indicating that the `ratings` service is being called by the "v2" version of the `reviews` service.
   
   If you log in as any other user (or logout) you should see red rating stars with each review,
   indicating that the `ratings` service is being called by the "v3" version of the `reviews` service.

1. Explicitly deny access to version `v3` of the `reviews` service.

   Run the following command to set up the deny rule along with a handler and an instance.
   ```bash
   istioctl create -f samples/bookinfo/kube/mixer-rule-deny-label.yaml
   ```
   You can expect to see the output similar to the following:
   ```bash
   Created config denier/default/denyreviewsv3handler at revision 2882105
   Created config checknothing/default/denyreviewsv3request at revision 2882106
   Created config rule/default/denyreviewsv3 at revision 2882107
   ```
   Notice the following in the `denyreviewsv3` rule:
   ```
   match: destination.labels["app"] == "ratings" && source.labels["app"]=="reviews" && source.labels["version"] == "v3"
   ```
   It matches requests coming from the service `reviews` with label `v3` to the service `ratings`.

   This rule uses the `denier` adapter to deny requests coming from version `v3` of the reviews service.
   The adapter always denies requests with a pre-configured status code and message.
   The status code and the message is specified in the [denier]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/adapters/denier.html)
   adapter configuration.
  
1. Refresh the `productpage` in your browser.

   If you are logged out or logged in as any user other than "jason" you will no longer see red ratings stars because
   the `reviews:v3` service has been denied access to the `ratings` service.
   In contrast, if you log in as user "jason" (the `reviews:v2` user) you continue to see
   the black ratings stars.

## Access control using _whitelists_ 

Istio also supports attribute-based whitelists and blacklists. The following whitelist configuration is equivalent to the
`denier` configuration in the previous section. The rule effectively rejects requests from version `v3` of the `reviews` service.

1. Remove the denier configuration that you added in the previous section.
   ```bash
   istioctl delete -f samples/bookinfo/kube/mixer-rule-deny-label.yaml
   ```

1. Verify that when you access the BookInfo `productpage` (http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage) without logging in, you see red stars.
   After performing the following steps you will no longer be able to see stars unless you are logged in as "jason".

1. Create configuration for the [`list`]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/adapters/list.html)
   adapter that lists versions `v1, v2`.
   Save the following YAML snippet as `whitelist-handler.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
   kind: listchecker
   metadata:
     name: whitelist
   spec:
     # providerUrl: ordinarily black and white lists are maintained
     # externally and fetched asynchronously using the providerUrl.
     overrides: ["v1", "v2"]  # overrides provide a static list
     blacklist: false
   ```
  and then run the following command:

   ```bash
   istioctl create -f whitelist-handler.yaml
   ```

1. Extract the version label by creating an instance of the [`listentry`]({{home}}/docs/reference/config/template/listentry.html) template.
Save the following YAML snippet as `appversion-instance.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
   kind: listentry
   metadata:
     name: appversion
   spec:
     value: source.labels["version"]
   ```
  and then run the following command:

   ```bash
   istioctl create -f appversion-instance.yaml
   ```

1. Enable `whitelist` checking for the ratings service.
Save the following YAML snippet as `checkversion-rule.yaml`:


   ```yaml
   apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
   kind: rule
   metadata:
     name: checkversion
   spec:
     match: destination.labels["app"] == "ratings"
     actions:
     - handler: whitelist.listchecker
       instances:
       - appversion.listentry
   ```
  and then run the following command:

   ```bash
   istioctl create -f checkversion-rule.yaml
   ```

1. Verify that when you access the BookInfo `productpage` (http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage) without logging in, you see **no** stars.
Verify that after logging in as "jason" you see black stars.

## Cleanup

* Remove the mixer configuration:

  ```bash
  istioctl delete -f checkversion-rule.yaml
  istioctl delete -f appversion-instance.yaml
  istioctl delete -f whitelist-handler.yaml
  ```

* Remove the application routing rules:

  ```
  istioctl delete -f samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-test-v2.yaml
  istioctl delete -f samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-v3.yaml
  ```

* If you are not planning to explore any follow-on tasks, refer to the
  [BookInfo cleanup]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html#cleanup) instructions
  to shutdown the application.
