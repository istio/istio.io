Through this task, you will learn how to:

* Use authentication policy to setup mutual TLS.

* Use authentication policy to do end-user authentication.

## Before you begin

* Understand Istio [authentication policy]({{home}}/docs/concepts/security/authn-policy.html) and related [mutual TLS authentication]({{home}}/docs/concepts/security/mutual-tls.html) concepts.

* Know how to verify mTLS setup (recommend to walk through [testing Istio mutual TLS authentication]({{home}}/docs/tasks/security/mutual-tls.html))

* Have a Kubernetes cluster with Istio installed, without mTLS. See [the Istio installation task]({{home}}/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html) and follow step 5.

*   For demo, create two namespaces `foo` and `bar`, and deploy [httpbin](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/httpbin) and [sleep](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/sleep) with sidecar on both of them. Also, run another sleep app without sidecar (to keep it separate, run it in `legacy` namespace)

    ```command
    $ kubectl create ns foo
    $ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml) -n foo
    $ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/sleep/sleep.yaml) -n foo
    $ kubectl create ns bar
    $ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml) -n bar
    $ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/sleep/sleep.yaml) -n bar
    $ kubectl create ns legacy
    $ kubectl apply -f samples/sleep/sleep.yaml -n legacy
    ```

*   Verifying setup by sending an http request (using curl command) from any sleep pod (among those in namespace `foo`, `bar` or `legacy`) to either `httpbin.foo` or `httpbin.bar`. All requests should success with HTTP code 200.

    For example, here is a command to check `sleep.bar` to `httpbin.foo` reachability:

    ```command
    $ kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n bar -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c sleep -n bar -- curl http://httpbin.foo:8000/ip -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
    200
    ```

    Conveniently, this one-liner command iterates through all combinations:

    ```command
    $ for from in "foo" "bar" "legacy"; do for to in "foo" "bar"; do kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n ${from} -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c sleep -n ${from} -- curl http://httpbin.${to}:8000/ip -s -o /dev/null -w "sleep.${from} to httpbin.${to}: %{http_code}\n"; done; done
    sleep.foo to httpbin.foo: 200
    sleep.foo to httpbin.bar: 200
    sleep.bar to httpbin.foo: 200
    sleep.bar to httpbin.bar: 200
    sleep.legacy to httpbin.foo: 200
    sleep.legacy to httpbin.bar: 200
    ```

*   Also verify that there are no authentication policy in the system

    ```command
    $ kubectl get policies.authentication.istio.io -n foo
    $ kubectl get policies.authentication.istio.io -n bar
    No resources found.
    ```

## Enable mTLS for all services in namespace `foo`

Run this command to set namespace-level policy for namespace `foo`.

```bash
cat <<EOF | istioctl create -f -
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "enable-mtls"
  namespace: "foo"
spec:
  peers:
  - mtls:
EOF
```

And verify the policy was added:

```command
$ kubectl get policies.authentication.istio.io -n foo
NAME          AGE
enable-mtls   1m
```

Run the same testing command above. We should see request from `sleep.legacy` to `httpbin.foo` start to fail, as the result of enabling mTLS for `httpbin.foo` but `sleep.legacy` doesn't have sidecar to support it. On the other hand, for clients with sidecar (`sleep.foo` and `sleep.bar`), Istio automatically configures them to using mTLS where talking to `http.foo`, so they continue to work. Also, requests to `httpbin.bar` are not affected as the policy is effective on the `foo` namespace only.

```command
$ for from in "foo" "bar" "legacy"; do for to in "foo" "bar"; do kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n ${from} -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c sleep -n ${from} -- curl http://httpbin.${to}:8000/ip -s -o /dev/null -w "sleep.${from} to httpbin.${to}: %{http_code}\n"; done; done
sleep.foo to httpbin.foo: 200
sleep.foo to httpbin.bar: 200
sleep.bar to httpbin.foo: 200
sleep.bar to httpbin.bar: 200
sleep.legacy to httpbin.foo: 000
command terminated with exit code 56
sleep.legacy to httpbin.bar: 200
```

## Enable mTLS for single service `httpbin.bar`

Run this command to set another policy only for `httpbin.bar` service. Note in this example, we do **not** specify namespace in metadata but put it in the command line (`-n bar`). They should work the same.

```bash
cat <<EOF | istioctl create -n bar -f -
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "enable-mtls"
spec:
  targets:
  - name: httpbin
  peers:
  - mtls:
EOF
```

Again, run the probing command. As expected, request from `sleep.legacy` to `httpbin.bar` starts failing with the same reasons.

```plain
...
sleep.legacy to httpbin.bar: 000
command terminated with exit code 56
```

If we have more services in namespace `bar`, we should see traffic to them won't be affected. Instead of adding more services to demonstrate this behavior, we edit the policy slightly:

```bash
cat <<EOF | istioctl replace -n bar -f -
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "enable-mtls"
spec:
  targets:
  - name: httpbin
    ports:
    - number: 1234
  peers:
  - mtls:
EOF
```

This new policy will apply only to the `httpbin` service on port `1234`. As a result, mTLS is disabled (again) on port `8000` and requests from `sleep.legacy` will resume working.

```command
$ kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n legacy -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c sleep -n legacy -- curl http://httpbin.bar:8000/ip -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
200
```

## Having both namespace-level and service-level policies

Assuming we already added the namespace-level policy that enables mTLS for all services in namespace `foo` and observe that request from `sleep.legacy` to `httpbin.foo` are failing (see above). Now add another policy that disables mTLS (peers section is empty) specifically for the `httpbin` service:

```bash
cat <<EOF | istioctl create -n foo -f -
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "httpbin"
spec:
  targets:
  - name: httpbin
EOF
```

Re-run the request from `sleep.legacy`, we should see a success return code again (200), confirming service-level policy overrules the namespace-level policy.

```command
$ kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n legacy -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c sleep -n legacy -- curl http://httpbin.foo:8000/ip -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
200
```

## Setup end-user authentication

You will need a valid JWT (corresponding to the JWKS endpoint you want to use for the demo). Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/security/tools/jwt) to create one. You can also use your own JWT/JWKS endpoint for the demo. Once you have that, export to some environment variables.

```command
$ export JWKS=https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/<YOUR-SVC-ACCOUNT>
$ export TOKEN=<YOUR-TOKEN>
```

Also, for convenience, expose `httpbin.foo` via ingress (for more details, see [ingress task]({{home}}/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress.html)).

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: httpbin-ingress
  namespace: foo
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: istio
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /headers
        backend:
          serviceName: httpbin
          servicePort: 8000
EOF
```

Get ingress IP
```command
export INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl get ing -n foo -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

And run a test query

```command-output-as-json
$ curl $INGRESS_HOST/headers -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
{
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Content-Length": "0",
    "Host": "35.230.123.105",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.58.0",
    "X-B3-Sampled": "1",
    "X-B3-Spanid": "d729acfa46c072ba",
    "X-B3-Traceid": "d729acfa46c072ba",
    "X-Envoy-Internal": "true",
    "X-Ot-Span-Context": "d729acfa46c072ba;d729acfa46c072ba;0000000000000000",
    "X-Request-Id": "8f232322-7c73-9470-8481-5ab64233adf9"
  }
}
```

Now, let's add a policy that requires end-user JWT for `httpbin.foo`. The next command assumes policy with name "httpbin" already exists (which should be if you follow previous sections). You can run `kubectl get policies.authentication.istio.io -n foo` to confirm, and use `istio create` (instead of `istio replace`) if resource is not found. Also note in this policy, peer authentication (mTLS) is also set, though it can be removed without affecting origin authentication settings.

```bash
cat <<EOF | istioctl replace -n foo -f -
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "httpbin"
spec:
  targets:
  - name: httpbin
  peers:
  - mtls:
  origins:
  - jwt:
      issuer: "YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL"
      jwksUri: $JWKS
  principalBinding: USE_ORIGIN
EOF
```

The same curl command from before will return with 401 error code, as a result of server is expecting JWT but none was provided:

```command
$ curl $INGRESS_HOST/headers -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
401
```

Attaching the valid token generated above returns success:

```command
$ curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $INGRESS_HOST/headers -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
```

You may want to try to modify token or policy (e.g change issuer, audiences, expiry date etc) to observe other aspects of JWT validation.
