This task shows you how to use Istio to dynamically limit the traffic to a service.

## Before you begin

* Setup Istio in a Kubernetes cluster by following the quick start instructions in the
  [Installation guide]({{home}}/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html).

* Deploy the [BookInfo]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html) sample application.

* Initialize the application version routing to direct `reviews` service requests from
  test user "jason" to version v2 and requests from any other user to v3.

  ```bash
  istioctl create -f samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-test-v2.yaml
  istioctl create -f samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-v3.yaml
  ```
  
  > Note: if you have conflicting rule that you set in previous tasks,
    use `istioctl replace` instead of `istioctl create`.

## Rate limits

Istio enables users to rate limit traffic to a service.
 
Consider `ratings` as an external paid service like Rotten TomatoesÂ® with `1qps` free quota.
Using Istio we can ensure that `1qps` is not breached.  

1. Point your browser at the BookInfo `productpage` (http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage). 

   If you log in as user "jason", you should see black ratings stars with each review,
   indicating that the `ratings` service is being called by the "v2" version of the `reviews` service.
   
   If you log in as any other user (or logout) you should see red ratings stars with each review,
   indicating that the `ratings` service is being called by the "v3" version of the `reviews` service.

1. Configure a `memquota` adapter with rate limits. 
   
   Save the following YAML snippet as `ratelimit-handler.yaml`.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
   kind: memquota
   metadata:
     name: handler
     namespace: istio-system
   spec:
     quotas:
     - name: requestcount.quota.istio-system
       # default rate limit is 5000qps
       maxAmount: 5000
       validDuration: 1s
       # The first matching override is applied.
       # A requestcount instance is checked against override dimensions.
       overrides:
       # The following override applies to traffic from 'rewiews' version v2,
       # destined for the ratings service. The destinationVersion dimension is ignored.
       - dimensions:
           destination: ratings
           source: reviews
           sourceVersion: v2
         maxAmount: 1
         validDuration: 1s
   ```

   and then run the following command:

   ```bash
   istioctl create -f ratelimit-handler.yaml
   ```
 
   This configuration specifies a default 5000 qps rate limit. Traffic reaching the ratings service via
   reviews-v2 is subject to a 1qps rate limit. In our example user "jason" is routed via reviews-v2 and is therefore subject
   to the 1qps rate limit.
 
1. Configure rate limit instance and rule

   Create a quota instance named `requestcount` that maps incoming attributes to quota dimensions,
   and create a rule that uses it with the memquota handler.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
   kind: quota
   metadata:
     name: requestcount
     namespace: istio-system
   spec:
     dimensions:
       source: source.labels["app"] | source.service | "unknown"
       sourceVersion: source.labels["version"] | "unknown"
       destination: destination.labels["app"] | destination.service | "unknown"
       destinationVersion: destination.labels["version"] | "unknown"
   ---
   apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
   kind: rule
   metadata:
     name: quota
     namespace: istio-system
   spec:
     actions:
     - handler: handler.memquota
       instances:
       - requestcount.quota
   ```

   Save the configuration as `ratelimit-rule.yaml` and run the following command:

   ```bash
   istioctl create -f ratelimit-rule.yaml
   ```

1. Generate load on the `productpage` with the following command:

   ```bash
   while true; do curl -s -o /dev/null http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage; done
   ```

1. Refresh the `productpage` in your browser.

   If you log in as user "jason" while the load generator is running (i.e., generating more than 1 req/s), 
   the traffic generated by your browser will be rate limited to 1qps.
   The reviews-v2 service is unable to access the ratings service and you stop seeing stars.
   For all other users the default 5000qps rate limit will apply and you will continue seeing red stars.

## Conditional rate limits

In the previous example we applied a rate limit to the `ratings` service without regard
to non-dimension attributes. It is possible to conditionally apply rate limits based on arbitrary
attributes using a match condition in the quota rule.

For example, consider the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
kind: rule
metadata:
 name: quota
 namespace: istio-system
spec:
 match: source.namespace != destination.namespace
 actions:
 - handler: handler.memquota
   instances:
   - requestcount.quota

```

This configuration applies the quota rule to requests whose source and destination namespaces are different.

## Understanding rate limits

In the preceding examples we saw how Mixer applies rate limits to requests that match certain conditions.

Every named quota instance like `requestcount` represents a set of counters.
The set is defined by a Cartesian product of all quota dimensions.
If the number of requests in the last `expiration` duration exceed `maxAmount`,  Mixer returns a `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
message to the proxy. The proxy in turn returns status `HTTP 429` to the caller. 

The `memquota` adapter uses a sliding window of sub second resolution to enforce rate limits. 

The `maxAmount` in the adapter configuration sets the default limit for all counters associated with a quota instance.
This default limit applies if a quota override does not match the request. Memquota selects the first override that matches a request.
An override need not specify all quota dimensions. In the ratelimit-handler.yaml example, the `1qps` override is
selected by matching only three out of four quota dimensions. 

If you would like the above policies enforced for a given namespace instead of the entire Istio mesh, you can replace all occurrences of istio-system with the given namespace. 

## Cleanup

* Remove the rate limit configuration:

  ```bash
  istioctl delete -f ratelimit-handler.yaml
  istioctl delete -f ratelimit-rule.yaml
  ```

* Remove the application routing rules:

  ```
  istioctl delete -f samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-test-v2.yaml
  istioctl delete -f samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-v3.yaml
  ```

* If you are not planning to explore any follow-on tasks, refer to the
  [BookInfo cleanup]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html#cleanup) instructions
  to shutdown the application.
