This task shows you how to use Istio to dynamically limit the traffic to a service.

## Before you begin

* Setup Istio by following the instructions in the
  [Installation guide](./installing-istio.html).

* Deploy the [BookInfo]({{home}}/docs/samples/bookinfo.html) sample application.

* Initialize the application version routing by either first doing the
  [request routing](./request-routing.html) task or by running following
  commands:
  
  ```bash
  istioctl create -f route-rule-all-v1.yaml
  istioctl replace -f route-rule-reviews-v2-v3.yaml
  ```
* Ensure that you can use [istioctl mixer]({{home}}/docs/reference/commands/istioctl.html#istioctl-mixer) by setting up port forwading if needed.

## Rate limits

Istio enables users to rate limit traffic to a service.
 
Consider `ratings` as an external paid service like Rotten Tomatoes® with `1qps` free quota.
Using Istio we can ensure that `1qps` is not breached.  

1. Configure mixer with the rate limit:

   ```bash
   istioctl mixer rule create global ratings.default.svc.cluster.local -f ratelimit.yml
   ```
   where ratelimit.yml is 
   ```yaml
   rules:
   - aspects:
     - kind: quotas
       params:
         quotas:
         - descriptorName: RequestCount
           maxAmount: 5
           expiration: 5s
   ```
   `istioctl` sets configuration for `subject=ratings.default.svc.cluster.local`

2. Generate load on the `productpage` with the following command:

   ```bash
   while true; do curl -s -o /dev/null http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage; done
   ```
   
   If you refresh the `productpage` (http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage) while the load 
   generator is running (i.e., generating more than 5 req/s), the traffic generated by
   your browser will be rate limited. When `reviews` service is unable to access `ratings`
   service you stop seeing stars on the UI.

## Conditional rate limits

In the previous example we applied a rate limit to the `ratings` service without regard
to any other attributes. It is possible to conditionally apply rate limits based on 
attributes like the source of the traffic.

The following configuration applies a `5qps` rate limit only to version `v3` of `reviews`.

1. Configure mixer with the conditional rate limit:

   ```bash
   istioctl mixer rule create global ratings.default.svc.cluster.local -f ratelimit-conditional.yml
   ```
   where ratelimit-conditional.yml is 
   ```yaml
   rules:
   - selector: source.labels["app"]=="reviews" && source.labels["version"] == "v3"  
     aspects:
     - kind: quotas
       params:
         quotas:
         - descriptorName: RequestCount
           maxAmount: 5
           expiration: 5s
   ```
2. Generate load on the `productpage` with the following command:

   ```bash
   while true; do curl -s -o /dev/null http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage; done
   ```
   
   If you refresh the `productpage` (http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage) while the load 
   generator is running (i.e., generating more than 1 req/s), the traffic generated by
   your browser will be rate limited. 

   Since the `reviews-v3` service is unable to access the `ratings` service freely, we stop seeing `red` stars on the UI.

## Understanding rate limits

In the preceding examples we saw how Mixer applies rate limits to requests that match certain conditions.

Every distinct rate limit configuration represents a counter. If the number
of requests in the last `expiration` duration exceed `maxAmount`,  Mixer returns a `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
message to the proxy. The proxy in turn returns status `HTTP 429` to the caller. 

Multiple rate limits may apply to the same request. 

Mixer `MemQuota` adapter uses a sliding window of sub second resolution to enforce rate limits. 

Consider the following example

```yaml
descriptorName: RequestCount
maxAmount: 5000
expiration: 5s
labels:
  label1: target.service
```
This defines a set of counters with a limit of `5000` per every `5 seconds`. 
Individual counters within the set are identified by unique keys. A key is formed on the request path by using all parameters
of the configuration. Here we introduce the notion of labels that enable creation of more granular counter keys.
When a request arrives at Mixer with `target.service=ratings` it forms the following counter key.

```$aspect_id;RequestCount;maxAmount=5000;expiration=5s;label1=ratings ```

Using `target.service` in the counter key enables independent rate limits for every service. 
In absence of `target.service` as part of the key, the same counter location is used by all services resulting in 
combined rate limit of `5000` requests per `5 seconds`

Mixer supports an arbitrary number of labels by defining `QuotaDescriptors`.
```yaml
name: RequestCount
rate_limit: true
labels:
   label1: 1 # STRING
```
Here we define `RequestCount` quota descriptor that takes 1 string label. We recommend using meaningful label names 
even though label names are arbitrary.

```yaml
name: RequestCount_byService_byUser
rate_limit: true
labels:
   service: 1 # STRING
   user: 1 # STRING
```
Mixer expects `user,service` labels when the `RequestCount_byService_byUser` descriptor is used and produces 
the following config validation error if any labels are missing.
```bash
* quotas: aspect validation failed: 1 error occurred:
* quotas[RequestCount_byService_byUser].labels: wrong dimensions: descriptor expects 2 labels, found 0 labels
```
