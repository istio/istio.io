The page explains Mixer's role and general architecture.

## Background

Infrastructure backends are designed to provide support functionality that is
used to build services. They include such things as access control systems,
telemetry capturing systems, quota enforcement systems, billing systems, and so
forth. Services traditionally directly integrate with these backend systems,
creating a hard coupling and baking-in specific semantics and usage options.

Mixer provides a generic intermediation layer between application code and
infrastructure backends. Its design moves policy decisions out of the app layer
and into configuration instead, under operator control. Instead of having
application code integrate with specific backends, the app code instead does a
fairly simple integration with Mixer, and Mixer takes responsibility for
interfacing with the backend systems.

Mixer is designed to change the boundaries between layers in order to reduce
systemic complexity, eliminating policy logic from service code and giving
control to operators instead.

Mixer provides three core features:

- **Precondition Checking**. Enables callers to verify a number of preconditions
  before responding to an incoming request from a service consumer.
  Preconditions can include whether the service consumer is properly
  authenticated, is on the service's whitelist, passes ACL checks, and more.

- **Quota Management**. Enables services to allocate and free quota on a number
  of dimensions. Quotas are used as a relatively simple resource management tool
  to provide some fairness between service consumers when contending for limited
  resources. Rate limits are examples of quotas.

- **Telemetry Reporting**. Enables services to report logging and monitoring. In
  the future, it will also enable tracing and billing streams intended for both
  the service operator as well as for service consumers.

These mechanisms are applied based on a set of [attributes](./attributes.html)
that are materialized for every request into Mixer. Within Istio, the attributes
are generated by a sidecar proxy (typically, Envoy) per request.

## Adapters

Mixer is a highly modular and extensible component. One of its key functions is
to abstract away the details of different policy and telemetry backend systems,
allowing Envoy and Istio-based services to be agnostic of those backends, which
keeps them portable.

Mixer's flexibility in dealing with different infrastructure backends is
achieved by having a general-purpose plug-in model. Individual plug-ins are
known as *adapters* and they allow Mixer to interface to different
infrastructure backends that deliver core functionality, such as logging,
monitoring, quotas, ACL checking, and more. Adapters enable Mixer to expose a
single consistent API, independent of the backends in use. The exact set of
adapters used at runtime is determined through configuration and can easily be
extended to target new or custom infrastructure backends.

## Configuration state

Mixer's core runtime methods (`Check` and `Report`) accept a set of attributes
on input. Mixer's current configuration dictates the work that the individual
methods perform with the set of input attributes. To that end, the service
operator is responsible for:

- Configuring a set of *handlers* for Mixer-generated data. Handlers are
  configured adapters (adapters being binary plugins as described
  [below](#adapters)). Providing a `statsd` adapter with the IP address for a
  statsd backend is an example of handler configuration.

- Configuring a set of *instances* for Mixer to generate based on attributes and
  literal values. They represent a chunk of data that adapter code will operate
  on. For example, an operator may configure Mixer to generate `request_count`
  metric values from attributes such as `destination.service` and
  `response.code`.

- Configuring a set of *rules* that Mixer will execute for each request. Rules
  consist of a *match* expression and *actions*. The match expression controls
  when Mixer will execute the specified actions. Actions specify the set of
  instances to generate and the handlers that should process the generated
  instances. For example, a rule might tell Mixer to send generated
  `requestcount` instances to a `statsd` handler for all `Report` calls.

The above configuration state is required to have Mixer know what to do with
incoming attributes and dispatch to the appropriate infrastructure backends.

Refer [here](./mixer-config.html) for detailed information on Mixer's
configuration model.

## Request phases

When a request comes in to Mixer, it goes through a number of distinct handling
phases:

- **Supplementary Attribute Production**. Mixer initially runs a globally
  configured set of adapters that are responsible for introducing new attributes.
  These attributes are combined with the attributes from the request to form the
  total set of attributes for the operation.

- **Resolution**. The second phase is to evaluate the set of attributes to
  determine the effective configuration to apply for the request. See
  [here](./mixer-config.html#resolution) for information on how resolution
  works. The effective configuration determines the set of aspects and
  descriptors available to handle the request in the subsequent phases.

- **Attribute Processing**. The third phase takes the total set of attributes
  and produces a set of *adapter parameters*. Attribute processing is initially
  configured through a simple declarative form as described
  [here](./mixer-config.html).

- **Adapter Dispatching**. The Resolution phase establishes the set of available
  aspects and the Attribute Processing phase creates a set of adapter
  parameters. The Adapter Dispatching phase invokes the adapters associated with
  each aspect and passes them those parameters.
