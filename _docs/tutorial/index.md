Step-by-step introductory tutorial to microservices based on the [Istio Bookinfo sample](https://istio.io/docs/guides/bookinfo.html).

This tutoral demonstrates a single microservice as a web app, node.js, Docker. Then it proceeds to a whole application (Bookinfo), composed of multiple microservices, managed by Kubernetes with Istio. The learning modules show evolution of the application: development of a single microservice, creating a container, deploying the application to Kubernetes, adding Istio to the Kubernetes cluster, deploying new microservice versions, routing traffic to a new version, and finally, monitoring, logging, distributed tracing, fault injection and security policies. The Istio features are presented as part of the developing story. The focus is on why the presented Istio features are required and what can be achieved using Istio. While presenting Istio features, various microservices concepts are briefly described. In the summary module, links to further Istio documents are provided.
