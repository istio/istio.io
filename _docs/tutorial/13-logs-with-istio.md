Logs and monitoring are a very important aspect of microservices architecture. It is so important that it is considered one of the three prerequisites for transition to the microservices architecture style. No monitoring - no transition. (The other two requirements are _rapid provisioning_ and _rapid deployment_, according to [this article](https://aadrake.com/posts/2017-05-20-enough-with-the-microservices.html)).

In this step, we will add collecting logs with Istio to our application.

1. We will deploy [Prometheus time series database and monitoring system](https://prometheus.io) for logs collection.
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/addons/prometheus.yaml
   ```

2. Define a log stream and a metric for Istio to collect into the Prometheus instance:
   ```bash
   istioctl create -f samples/bookinfo/istio.io-tutorial/telemetry.yaml
   ```
   The metric's name is `istio_bookinfo_request_count`.

2. Check the pods at istio-system namespaces and wait for the pod of Prometheus to start running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n istio-system
   ```
2. Access the application webpage a couple of times.

3. Perform port forwarding from the Prometheus instance to our machine:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=prometheus -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 9090:9090 &
   ```
4. Access [the Prometheus instance on our localhost](http://localhost:9090/graph#%5B%7B%22range_input%22%3A%221h%22%2C%22expr%22%3A%22istio_bookinfo_request_count%22%2C%22tab%22%3A1%7D%5D) to see our metric values.

5. Swiftch to the `Graph` tab to see a graph of our metric.

6. See the collected log:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n istio-system logs $(kubectl -n istio-system get pods -l istio=mixer -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') mixer | grep \"instance\":\"newlog.logentry.istio-system\"
   ```

  Note that the log entries from all the bookinfo microservices appear in one place. We do not have to go after each and every microservice and to display their logs one by one.
