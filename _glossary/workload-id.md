title: Workload ID
type: markdown
---
A unique identifier for an individual instance of a **Workload**.
Like **Workload Name**, **Workload ID** is not a strongly verified property and should not be used when enforcing ACLs.
  * **Workload IDs** are accessible in Istio configuration as the `source.uid` and `destination.uid` attributes.
