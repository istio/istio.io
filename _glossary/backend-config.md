type: markdown

Backend config is not part of [Istio config](#istio-config). These are the
configs for Istio infrastructure backends. Backend config defines the
management resources, such as quota, monitoring that will be used to accept
runtime control requests from Istio through Mixer adapters. Backend config may
live in cloud vendors.
