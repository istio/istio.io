In addition to the usual pile of bug fixes and performance improvements, this release includes the new or
updated features detailed below.

## Networking

- **Revamped Traffic Management Model**. We're finally ready to take the wraps off our new traffic
management configuration model. The new model adds many new features and addresses usability issues
with the prior model.

- **Envoy V2**. Pilot now uses the V2 Envoy API to program the proxies in the mesh, which increases
effective scalability and eliminates spurious 404 errors.

- **Constrain inbound ports**. Restrict the inbound ports in a pod to the ones needed by the apps running inside that pod.

## Security

- **Introducing Citadel**. We've finally given a name to our security component. What was
formerly known a Istio-Auth or Istio-CA is now called Citadel.

- **Multicluster Support**. [TBD: What should we say?]

- **Authentication Filter**. [TBD: What should we say about the proxy authn filter?]

- **Per-Namespace Authorization Policy**. [TBD]

## Istio Telemetry

- **Self-Reporting**.  Istio components (Mixer, Pilot, Citadel) now produce telemetry that flows through the normal
Istio telemetry pipeline, just like services in the mesh.

## Configuration Model

## Mixer adapters

- **CloudWatch**. Mixer can now report metrics to AWS CloudWatch.

## Known issues with 0.8

- A gateway with virtual services to headerless service won't work ([Issue #5005](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/5005)).

- Istio-ingress won't have any route rule support. Users must move to the new Gateway and new route
rule to get this path working. ([Issue #296](https://github.com/istio/issues/issues/296)).
