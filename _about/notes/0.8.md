In addition to the usual pile of bug fixes and performance improvements, this release includes the new or
updated features detailed below.

## Networking

- **Revamped Traffic Management Model**. We're finally ready to take the wraps off our new traffic
management configuration model. The new model adds many new features and addresses usability issues
with the prior model. There is a conversion tool built into `istioctl` to help migrate your config from
the old model. [Learn more]({{home}}/docs/tasks/traffic-management-v1alpha3/)

- **Envoy V2**. Pilot now uses the V2 Envoy API to program the proxies in the mesh, which increases
effective scalability and eliminates spurious 404 errors.

- **Constrain Inbound Ports**. Restrict the inbound ports in a pod to the ones needed by the apps running inside that pod.

## Security

- **Introducing Citadel**. We've finally given a name to our security component. What was
formerly known as Istio-Auth or Istio-CA is now called Citadel.

- **Multicluster Support**. We support per-cluster Citadel in multicluster deployments such that all Citadels share the same root cert
and workloads can authenticate each other across the mesh.

- **Authentication Policy**. We're introduced authentication policy that can be used to configure service-to-service
authentication (mutual TLS) and end user authentication. This is the recommended way for enabling mutual TLS
(over the existing config flag and service annotations).

## Telemetry

- **Self-Reporting**. Mixer and Pilot now produce telemetry that flows through the normal
Istio telemetry pipeline, just like services in the mesh.

## Setup

- **A la Carte Istio**. You can now adopt Istio in pieces (security features, policy features, etc.) via helm chart
options. [TBD: do we have docs on this?]

## Mixer adapters

- **CloudWatch**. Mixer can now report metrics to AWS CloudWatch.

## Known issues with 0.8

- A gateway with virtual services to headless service won't work ([Issue #5005](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/5005)).

- Istio-ingress won't have any route rule support. Users must move to the new Gateway and new route
rule to get this path working. ([Issue #296](https://github.com/istio/issues/issues/296)).
