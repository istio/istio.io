In addition to the usual pile of bug fixes and performance improvements, this release includes the new or
updated features detailed below.

## Networking

- **Revamped Traffic Management Model**. We're finally ready to take the wraps off our new traffic
management configuration model. The new model adds many new features and addresses usability issues
with the prior model.

- **IPv6**. [TBD: do we want to say anything about IPv6 support?]

- **Envoy V2**. [TBD: should we say anything about all the work to use the Envoy V2 API?
Does this have any user-visible effect?]

## Security

- **Multicluster Support**. [TBD: What should we say?]

- **Authentication Filter**. [TBD: What should we say about the proxy authn filter?]

## Istio Telemetry

- **Self-Reporting**.  Istio components (Mixer, Pilot, Citadel) now produce telemetry that flows through the normal
Istio telemetry pipeline, just like services in the mesh.

## Configuration Model

## Mixer adapters

- **CloudWatch**. Mixer can now report metrics to AWS CloudWatch.
