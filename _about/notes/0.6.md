## Other

- **Separate Check & Report Clusters**. When configuring Envoy, it's now possible to use different clusters
for Mixer instances that are used for Mixer's Check functionality from those used for Mixer's Report
functionality. This may be useful in large deployments for better scaling of Mixer instances.

- **Liveness and Readiness Probes**. Istio components now provide canonical liveness and readiness
probe support to help ensure mesh infrastructure health. [Learn more]({{home}}/docs/tasks/security/health-check.html)

- **Egress Policy and Telemetry**. Istio can monitor traffic to external services defined by EgressRule or External Service. Istio can also apply
Mixer policies on this traffic.
