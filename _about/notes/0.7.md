For this release, we focused on improving our build and test infrastructures and increasing the
quality of our tests. As a result, there are no new features for this month.

However, this release does include a large number of bug fixes and performance improvements.
Of particular interest, our [helm charts](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/helm.html)
have received a lot of attention and should not work reliably.

Please note that this release includes preliminary support for the new alpha3 traffic management
functionality. This functionality is still in a great deal of flux and they may be some breaking
changes in the 0.8. So if you feel like exploring, please go right ahead, but expect that this may
change in 0.8 and beyond.
