For this release, we focused on improving our build and test infrastructures and increasing the
quality of our tests. As a result, there are no new features for this month.

However, this release does include a large number of bug fixes and performance improvements.
Of particular interest, our [helm charts](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/helm.html)
have received a lot of attention and should not work reliably.
