**Fork** button in the upper-right area of the screen to
create a copy of our site in your GitHub account called a _fork_. Make any changes you want in your fork, and when you
are ready to send those changes to us, go to the index page for your fork and click **New Pull Request** to let us know about it.

> Once your changes have been committed, they will show up immediately on [preliminary.istio.io](https://preliminary.istio.io), but
will only show up on [istio.io](http://istio.io) the next time we produce a new release, which happens around once a month.
