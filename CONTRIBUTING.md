# Contribution guidelines

So you want to hack on Istio? Yay! Please refer to Istio's overall
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to find out how you can help.

## Promote your company on istio.io

If your company supports Istio, you can list it on our [Ecosystem page](https://istio.io/latest/about/ecosystem/).
We have categories for *providers* (who offer hosted or managed Istio services
to their customers), *professional services* (who offer implementation support
or consulting for Istio) and *integrations* (commercial or open source products
that work with Istio).

To add an entry to this page, edit [data/companies.yml](data/companies.yml)
and add your information in the `providers`, `pro_services` or `integrations`
section, as appropriate. Please add your company logo, preferably in SVG
format, to [static/logos](static/logos).

The Istio steering committee reserves the right to remove logos of companies that
are not demeed to be in good standing in the community.

## Tell the world you're using Istio

Are you running Istio in production?  List yourself on our [Case Studies](https://istio.io/latest/about/case-studies/) page.

If you want to add your logo to our wall of users, add an entry to the `users`
section in [data/companies.yml](data/companies.yml), and add your logo,
preferably in SVG format, to [static/logos](static/logos).

If you'd like to be interviewed for a full case study, please [create an issue](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/issues/new),
