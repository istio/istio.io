You can enable a PERMISSIVE mode for your service to take both mutual TLS and plain-text traffic.
To configure your service to accept both mutual TLS and plain-text traffic for health checking, please refer to the
[PERMISSIVE mode configuration documentation](/docs/tasks/security/mtls-migration/#configure-the-server-to-accept-both-mutual-tls-and-plain-text-traffic).
