title: Mixer Instance

{% include home.html %}

An instance represents a chunk of Mixer data that is produced by inspecting a
a set of request [attributes](#attribute) and applying the operator-supplied configuration.
Instances are delivered to individual [handlers](#mixer-handler), on their way to
infrastructure backends.
