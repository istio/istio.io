title: How to disable Auth on clients to access the Kubernetes API Server (or any control services that don't have Istio sidecar)?
weight: 60

Starting with release 0.3, edit the `mtlsExcludedServices` list in Istio config
map to contain the fully-qualified name of the API server (and any other
control services for that matter). The default value of `mtlsExcludedServices`
already contains `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`, which is the default
service name of the Kubernetes API server.

For a quick reference, here are commands to edit Istio configmap and to restart pilot.
```command
$ kubectl edit configmap -n istio-system istio
$ kubectl delete pods -n istio-system -l istio=pilot
```

> Do not use this approach to disable mTLS for services that are managed
by Istio (i.e. using Istio sidecar). Instead, use service-level annotations
to overwrite the authentication policy (see above).
