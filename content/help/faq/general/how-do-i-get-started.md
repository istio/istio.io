We recommend starting with the [Guides]({{home}}/docs/guides/), which walks
through different core Istio concepts in a tutorial style. The guides show
case intelligent routing, policy enforcement, security, telemetry, etc.

To start using Istio on your existing Kubernetes  or Consul deployment, please refer to our [Installation]({{home}}/docs/setup/) task guide.
