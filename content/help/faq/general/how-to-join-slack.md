Istio Slack is restricted to Istio Developers. See the [Community Roles](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/ROLES.md#member)
guide, specifically the **Member** role. In this page you can find instructions on how to apply for Istio membership.
If your membership request has been approved, you will be invited to join the Istio Slack workspace.

All users can interact in a real time chat using [Rocket Chat](https://istio.rocket.chat) though.
