To see trace data, you must send requests to your service. The number of requests depends on Istio's sampling rate.
You set this rate when you install Istio. The default sampling rate is 1%. You need to send at least 100 requests before the first trace is visible.
To send a 100 requests to the `productpage` service, use the following command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ for i in `seq 1 100`; do curl -s -o /dev/null http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage; done
