- Reuse previously cached JWT public keys if transport errors are encountered during renewal ([Issue 14638](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14638)).
- Bypass JWT authentication for HTTP OPTIONS methods to support CORS requests ([Issue 2160](https://github.com/istio/proxy/issues/2160)).

## Small enhancements

- Expose cryptographic signature verification functions to `Lua` Envoy filters ([Envoy Issue 7009](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/7009)).
