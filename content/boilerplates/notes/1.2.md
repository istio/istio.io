## Installation

- **Added** `global.proxy.resources.limits.memory` to allow users to limit the memory of sidecar proxies.
- **Added** pod anti-affinity and toleration support to all of our control plane components.
- **Added** `sidecarInjectorWebhook.neverInjectSelector` and `sidecarInjectorWebhook.alwaysInjectSelector` to allow users to further refine workloads that have sidecar automatically injected or not, based on label selectors.
- **Added** `global.logging.level` and `global.proxy.logLevel` to allow users to easily configure logs for control plane and data plane components globally.
- **Added** support to configure the Datadog location via `global.tracer.datadog.address`.

## Upgrades

- **Removed** deprecated Adapter and Template CRDs by default. Configure `mixer.templates.useTemplateCRDs=true` and `mixer.adapters.useAdapterCRDs=true` to re-enable them.

Refer to the [installation option change page](/docs/reference/config/installation-options-changes/) to view the complete list of changes.

## General

- **Added** `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts` annotation to eliminate the need for service owner to declare `containerPort` in the deployment yaml file.
- **Introduced** IPV6 alpha support for Kubernetes clusters.

## `istioctl` and `kubectl`

- **Graduated** `istioctl verify-install` out of experimental.
- **Improved** `istioctl verify-install` to validate if a given Kubernetes environment meets Istio's prerequisites.
- **Added** auto-completion support to `istioctl`.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental dashboard` to allow users to easily open the web UI of any Istio addons.
- **Added** `istioctl x` alias to conveniently run `istioctl experimental` command.
- **Improved** `istioctl version` to report both Istio control plane and `istioctl` version info by default.
- **Improved** `istioctl validate` to validate Mixer configuration and supports deep validation with referential integrity.

## Traffic Management

- **Improved** locality based routing in multicluster environments.
- **Improved** outbound traffic policy in `ALLOW_ANY` mode. Traffic for unknown HTTP/HTTPS hosts on an existing port will be forwarded as is. Unknown traffic will be logged in Envoy access logs.
- **Added** support for sending traces to Datadog.
- **Added** support for setting HTTP idle timeouts to upstream services.
- **Improved** Sidecar support for NONE mode (without iptables).
- **Added** support for configuring the paths for Istio mutual TLS certificates.
- **Added** ability to configure the DNS refresh rate for sidecar Envoys, to reduce the load on the DNS servers.

## Security

- **Added** Kubernetes health check prober rewrite per deployment via `sidecar.istio.io/rewriteAppHTTPProbers: "true"` in the `PodSpec` annotation.
- **Added** Support for [PKCS 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_8) private keys for workloads, enabled by the field `pkcs8-keys` on Citadel.
- **Fixed** SAN field in workload certificates is set as `critical`.
- **Improved** Added Jitter to Citadel Agent for sending CSR requests.
- **Improved** Extended the lifetime of self-signed Citadel root certificates to 10 years.
- **Improved** JWT public key fetching logic to make it more resilient to network failure.

## Telemetry

- **Added** Envoy metrics support to include metrics by prefixes, suffixes and regular expressions.
- **Changed** Prometheus generated traffic is excluded from metrics.

## Policy

- **Fixed** TCP Policy enforcement.

## Configuration Management

- **Added** ControlZ support to visualize the state of the MCP Server in Galley.
- **Enabled** validation of more Mixer CRDs in Galley validation webhook.
- **Added** support for specifying connection metadata for MCP dial-out mode in Galley.
- **Added** an explicit command-line flag to control the service discovery module in Galley.
- **Introduced** environment variable and configuration file support for configuring Galley, in addition to command-line flags.
- **Added** `InitialWindowSize` and `InitialConnWindowSize` parameters to Galley and Pilot to allow fine-tuning of MCP (gRPC) connection settings.
