## General

- **Added** `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts` annotation to eliminate the need for service owner to declare `containerPort` in the deployment yaml file.  This will become the default in a future release.
- **Added** IPv6 alpha support for Kubernetes clusters.

## Traffic Management

- **Improved** [locality based routing](/docs/ops/traffic-management/locality-load-balancing/) in multicluster environments. (link to doc)
- **Improved** outbound traffic policy in [`ALLOW_ANY` mode](/docs/reference/config/installation-options/#global-options). Traffic for unknown HTTP/HTTPS hosts on an existing port will be forwarded as is. Unknown traffic will be logged in Envoy access logs.
- **Added** support for setting HTTP idle timeouts to upstream services.
- **Improved** Sidecar support for NONE mode (without iptables) (link to doc).
- **Added** ability to configure the [DNS refresh rate](/docs/reference/config/installation-options/#global-options) for sidecar Envoys, to reduce the load on the DNS servers.

## Security

- **Improved** extended the lifetime of self-signed Citadel root certificates to 10 years.
- **Added** Kubernetes health check prober rewrite per deployment via `sidecar.istio.io/rewriteAppHTTPProbers: "true"` in the `PodSpec` annotation. (link to doc)
- **Added** support for configuring the secrete paths for Istio mutual TLS certificates.
- **Added** support for [PKCS 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_8) private keys for workloads, enabled by the field `pkcs8-keys` on Citadel.
- **Added** jitter(need a link) when sending CSR requests for certification generation.
- **Improved** JWT public key fetching logic to be more resilient to network failure.
- **Fixed** SAN field in workload certificates is set as `critical`. - need clear explanation
- **Fixed** mutual TLS probe rewrite for HTTPS probes.

## Telemetry

- - **Added** Full support for control over Envoy stats generation, based on stats prefixes, suffixes, and regular expressions through the use of [annotations](https://preliminary.istio.io/docs/reference/commands/pilot-agent/#annotations).
- **Changed** Prometheus generated traffic is excluded from metrics.
- **Added** support for sending traces to Datadog.

## Policy

- **Fixed** TCP Policy enforcement in Mixer.
- Any channge in istio RBAC?

## Configuration Management

- **Enabled** webhook validation of more CRDs.

## Installation and Upgrade

- **Updated** default proxy memory limit size from XX to XX.  Explain why?
- **Added** pod anti-affinity and toleration support to all of our control plane components. (link to k8s docs)
- **Added** `sidecarInjectorWebhook.neverInjectSelector` and `sidecarInjectorWebhook.alwaysInjectSelector` to allow users to further refine whether workloads should have sidecar automatically injected or not, based on label selectors.
- **Added** `global.logging.level` and `global.proxy.logLevel` to allow users to easily configure logs for control plane and data plane components globally.
- **Added** support to configure the Datadog location via `global.tracer.datadog.address`. (link to the page)
- **Removed** [deprecated Adapter and Template CRDs](https://discuss.istio.io/t/deprecation-notice-custom-mixer-adapter-crds/2055). Configure `mixer.templates.useTemplateCRDs=true` and `mixer.adapters.useAdapterCRDs=true` to re-enable them.

## `istioctl` and `kubectl`

- **Graduated** `istioctl verify-install` out of experimental.
- **Improved** `istioctl verify-install` to validate if a given Kubernetes environment meets Istio's prerequisites.
- **Added** auto-completion support to `istioctl`.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental dashboard` to allow users to easily open the web UI of any Istio addons.
- **Added** `istioctl x` alias to conveniently run `istioctl experimental` command.
- **Improved** `istioctl version` to report both Istio control plane and `istioctl` version info by default.
- **Improved** `istioctl validate` to validate Mixer configuration and supports deep validation with referential integrity.

## Other

- **Added** ControlZ (need a link) support to visualize the state of the MCP Server in Galley.
- **Added** an explicit command-line flag (ask Oz) to control the service discovery module in Galley.
- **Introduced** environment variable and configuration file support for configuring Galley, in addition to command-line flags.
- **Added** `InitialWindowSize` and `InitialConnWindowSize` parameters to Galley and Pilot to allow fine-tuning of MCP (gRPC) connection settings.
