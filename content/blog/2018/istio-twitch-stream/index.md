To celebrate the 1.0 release and to promote the software to a wider audience, the Istio community is hosting an all day live stream on Twitch on August 17th.

## What is Twitch?

[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/) is a popular video gaming live streaming platform and recently has seen a lot of coding content showing up. The IBM Advocates have been doing live coding and presentations there and it's been fun. While mostly used for gaming content, there is a [growing community](https://www.twitch.tv/communities/programming) sharing and watching programming content on the site.

## What does this have to do with Istio?

The stream is going to be a full day of Istio content. Hopefully we'll have a good mix of deep technical content, beginner content and line-of-business content for our audience. We'll have developers, users, and evangelists on throughout the day to share their demos and stories. Expect live coding, q and a, and some surprises. We have stellar guests lined up from IBM, Google, Datadog, Pivotal, and more!

## How do I watch?

It's easy! Just navigate [here](https://twitch.tv/ibmcode) on August 17th starting at 10 AM Pacific.

## I'd like to be on the stream

Oh good! We'd like to have you on as well. Reach out to ``@nibalizer`` on the Istio slack or rocket chat to get started.
