Welcome to the Istio blog!

To make it easier to publish your content on our website, we
[updated the content types guide](/about/contribute/creating-and-editing-pages/#choosing-a-page-type).

The goal of the updated guide is to make sharing and finding content easier.

We want to make sharing timely information on Istio easy and the Istio blog is
a good place to start.

We welcome your posts to the blog if you think your content falls in one of the
following four categories:

-  Your post details your experience using and configuring Istio. Ideally, your
   post shares a novel experience or perspective.
-  Your post highlights or announces Istio features.
-  Your post announces or recaps an Istio-related event.
-  Your post details how to accomplish a task or fulfill a specific use case
   using Istio.

Posting your blog is only [one PR away](/about/contribute/github/#how-to-contribute)
and, if you wish, you can [request a review](/about/contribute/github/#review).

We look forward to reading about your Istio experience on the blog soon!
