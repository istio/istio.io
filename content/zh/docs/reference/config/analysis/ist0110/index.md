title: ConflictingSidecarWorkloadSelectors

This message occurs when more than one Sidecar resource in a namespace selects the same workload instance. This can lead to undefined behavior. See the reference for the [Sidecar](/zh/docs/reference/config/networking/sidecar/) resource for more information.

To fix, ensure that the set of workload instances (e.g. pods) selected by each Sidecar workload selector in a namespace do not overlap.
