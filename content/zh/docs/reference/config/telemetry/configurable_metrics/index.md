Istio 1.5 includes `experimental` support for modifying Istio standard metrics and defining new ones.

The configuration steps are documented on the Istio [wiki](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Configurable-V2-Metrics).

{{< warning >}}
The API to configure the metrics is certain to change in Istio 1.6 as part of the extensions API design.
