title: Adapters
---

Adapters are plug-ins to [Mixer](#mixer), Istio's [policy and telemetry](/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/) component, which enable it to interface
with an open-ended set of infrastructure backends that deliver core functionality, such as logging,
monitoring, quotas, ACL checking, and more.
The exact set of adapters used at runtime is determined through configuration and can easily be
extended to target new or custom infrastructure backends.
