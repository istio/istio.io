title: Mixer Instance
---

An instance represents a chunk of Mixer data that is produced by inspecting a set of request [attributes](#%E5%B1%9E%E6%80%A7) and applying the operator-supplied configuration.
Instances are delivered to individual [handlers](#mixer-handler), on their way to
infrastructure backends.
