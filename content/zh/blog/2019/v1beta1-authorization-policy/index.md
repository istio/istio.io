Istio 1.4 introduces the
[`v1beta1` authorization policy](/zh/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/),
which is a major update to the previous `v1alpha1` role-based access control
(RBAC) policy. The new policy provides these improvements:

* Aligns with Istio configuration model.
* Improves the user experience by simplifying the API.
* Supports more use cases (e.g. Ingress/Egress gateway support) without
  added complexity.

The `v1beta1` policy is not backward compatible and requires a one time
conversion. A tool is provided to automate this process. The previous
configuration resources `ClusterRbacConfig`, `ServiceRole`, and
`ServiceRoleBinding` will not be supported from Istio 1.6 onwards.

This post describes the new `v1beta1` authorization policy model, its
design goals and the migration from `v1alpha1` RBAC policies. See the
[authorization concept page](/zh/docs/concepts/security/#authorization)
for a detailed in-depth explanation of the `v1beta1` authorization policy.

We welcome your feedback about the `v1beta1` authorization policy at
[discuss.istio.io](https://discuss.istio.io/c/security).

## Background

To date, Istio provided RBAC policies to enforce access control on
{{< gloss "service" >}}services{{< /gloss >}} using three configuration
resources: `ClusterRbacConfig`, `ServiceRole` and `ServiceRoleBinding`.
With this API, users have been able to enforce control access at mesh-level,
namespace-level and service-level. Like other RBAC policies, Istio RBAC uses
the same concept of role and binding for granting permissions to identities.

Although Istio RBAC has been working reliably, we've found that many
improvements were possible.

For example, users have mistakenly assumed that access control enforcement
happens at service-level because `ServiceRole` uses service to specify where
to apply the policy, however, the policy is actually applied on
{{< gloss "workload" >}}workloads{{< /gloss >}}, the service is only used to
find the corresponding workload. This nuance is significant when multiple
services are referring to the same workload. A `ServiceRole` for service A
will also affect service B if the two services are referring to the same
workload, which can cause confusion and incorrect configuration.

An other example is that it's proven difficult for users to maintain and
manage the Istio RBAC configurations because of the need to deeply understand
three related resources.

## Design goals

The new `v1beta1` authorization policy had several design goals:

* Align with [Istio Configuration Model](https://goo.gl/x3STjD) for better
  clarity on the policy target. The configuration model provides a unified
  configuration hierarchy, resolution and target selection.

* Improve the user experience by simplifying the API. It's easier to manage
  one custom resource definition (CRD) that includes all access control
  specifications, instead of multiple CRDs.

* Support more use cases without added complexity. For example, allow the
  policy to be applied on Ingress/Egress gateway to enforce access control
  for traffic entering/exiting the mesh.

## `AuthorizationPolicy`

An [`AuthorizationPolicy` custom resource](/zh/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/)
enables access control on workloads. This section gives an overview of the
changes in the `v1beta1` authorization policy.

An `AuthorizationPolicy` includes a `selector` and a list of `rule`.
The `selector` specifies on which workload to apply the policy and the
list of `rule` specifies the detailed access control rule for the workload.

The `rule` is additive, which means a request is allowed if any `rule`
allows the request. Each `rule` includes a list of `from`, `to` and
`when`, which specifies **who** is allowed to do **what** under which
**conditions**.

The `selector` replaces the functionality provided by `ClusterRbacConfig`
and the `services` field in `ServiceRole`. The `rule` replaces the other
fields in the `ServiceRole` and `ServiceRoleBinding`.

### Example

The following authorization policy applies to workloads with `app: httpbin`
and `version: v1` label in the `foo` namespace:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: httpbin
 namespace: foo
spec:
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: httpbin
     version: v1
 rules:
 - from:
   - source:
       principals: ["cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep"]
   to:
   - operation:
       methods: ["GET"]
   when:
   - key: request.headers[version]
     values: ["v1", "v2"]
{{< /text >}}

The policy allows principal `cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep` to access the
workload using the `GET` method when the request includes a `version` header
of value `v1` or `v2`. Any requests not matched with the policy will be denied
by default.

Assuming the `httpbin` service is defined as:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: foo
spec:
  selector:
    app: httpbin
    version: v1
  ports:
    # omitted
{{< /text >}}

You would need to configure three resources to achieve the same result in
`v1alpha1`:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ClusterRbacConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mode: 'ON_WITH_INCLUSION'
  inclusion:
    services: ["httpbin.foo.svc.cluster.local"]
---
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRole
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: foo
spec:
  rules:
  - services: ["httpbin.foo.svc.cluster.local"]
    methods: ["GET"]
    constraints:
    - key: request.headers[version]
      values: ["v1", "v2"]
---
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: foo
spec:
  subjects:
  - user: "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep"
  roleRef:
    kind: ServiceRole
    name: "httpbin"
{{< /text >}}

### Workload selector

A major change in the `v1beta1` authorization policy is that it now uses
workload selector to specify where to apply the policy. This is the same
workload selector used in the `Gateway`, `Sidecar` and `EnvoyFilter`
configurations.

The workload selector makes it clear that the policy is applied and enforced
on workloads instead of services. If a policy applies to a workload that is
used by multiple different services, the same policy will affect the traffic
to all the different services.

You can simply leave the `selector` empty to apply the policy to all
workloads in a namespace. The following policy applies to all workloads in
the namespace `bar`:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: policy
 namespace: bar
spec:
 rules:
 # omitted
{{< /text >}}

### Root namespace

A policy in the root namespace applies to all workloads in the mesh in every
namespaces. The root namespace is configurable in the
[`MeshConfig`](/zh/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#MeshConfig)
and has the default value of `istio-system`.

For example, you installed Istio in `istio-system` namespace and deployed
workloads in `default` and `bookinfo` namespace. The root namespace is
changed to `istio-config` from the default value. The following policy will
apply to workloads in every namespace including `default`, `bookinfo` and
the `istio-system`:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: policy
 namespace: istio-config
spec:
 rules:
 # omitted
{{< /text >}}

### Ingress/Egress Gateway support

The `v1beta1` authorization policy can also be applied on ingress/egress
gateway to enforce access control on traffic entering/leaving the mesh,
you only need to change the `selector` to make select the ingress/egress
workload.

The following policy applies to workloads with the
`app: istio-ingressgateway` label:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: ingress
 namespace: istio-system
spec:
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: istio-ingressgateway
 rules:
 # omitted
{{< /text >}}

Remember the authorization policy only applies to workloads in the same
namespace as the policy, unless the policy is applied in the root namespace:

* If you don't change the default root namespace value (i.e. `istio-system`),
  the above policy will apply to workloads with the `app: istio-ingressgateway`
  label in **every** namespace.

* If you have changed the root namespace to a different value, the above
  policy will only apply to workloads with the `app: istio-ingressgateway`
  label **only** in the `istio-system` namespace.

### Comparison

The following table highlights the key differences between the old `v1alpha1`
RBAC policies and the new `v1beta1` authorization policy.

#### Feature

| Feature | `v1alpha1` RBAC policy | `v1beta1` Authorization Policy |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| API stability | `alpha`: **No** backward compatible | `beta`: backward compatible **guaranteed** |
| Number of CRDs | Three: `ClusterRbacConfig`, `ServiceRole` and `ServiceRoleBinding` | Only One: `AuthorizationPolicy` |
| Policy target | **service** | **workload** |
| Deny-by-default behavior | Enabled **explicitly** by configuring `ClusterRbacConfig` | Enabled **implicitly** with `AuthorizationPolicy` |
| Ingress/Egress gateway support | Not supported | Supported |
| The `"*"` value in policy | Match all contents (empty and non-empty) | Match non-empty contents only |

The following tables show the relationship between the `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1` API.

#### `ClusterRbacConfig`

| `ClusterRbacConfig.Mode` | `AuthorizationPolicy` |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| `OFF` | No policy applied |
| `ON` | A deny-all policy applied in root namespace |
| `ON_WITH_INCLUSION` | policies should be applied to namespaces or workloads included by `ClusterRbacConfig` |
| `ON_WITH_EXCLUSION` | policies should be applied to namespaces or workloads excluded by `ClusterRbacConfig` |

#### `ServiceRole`

| `ServiceRole` | `AuthorizationPolicy` |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| `services` | `selector` |
| `paths` | `paths` in `to` |
| `methods` | `methods` in `to` |
| `destination.ip` in constraint | Not supported |
| `destination.port` in constraint | `ports` in `to` |
| `destination.labels` in constraint | `selector` |
| `destination.namespace` in constraint | Replaced by the namespace of the policy, i.e. the `namespace` in metadata |
| `destination.user` in constraint | Not supported |
| `experimental.envoy.filters` in constraint | `experimental.envoy.filters` in `when` |
| `request.headers` in constraint | `request.headers` in `when` |

#### `ServiceRoleBinding`

| `ServiceRoleBinding` | `AuthorizationPolicy` |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| `user`  | `principals` in `from` |
| `group` | `paths` in `to` |
| `source.ip` in property | `ipBlocks` in `from` |
| `source.namespace` in property | `namespaces` in `from` |
| `source.principal` in property | `principals` in `from` |
| `request.headers` in property | `request.headers` in `when` |
| `request.auth.principal` in property | `requestPrincipals` in `from` or `request.auth.principal` in `when` |
| `request.auth.audiences` in property | `request.auth.audiences` in `when` |
| `request.auth.presenter` in property | `request.auth.presenter` in `when` |
| `request.auth.claims` in property | `request.auth.claims` in `when` |

Beyond all the differences, the `v1beta1` policy is enforced by the same
engine in Envoy and supports the same authenticated identity (mutual TLS or
JWT), condition and other primitives (e.g. IP, port and etc.) as the
`v1alpha1` policy.

## Future of the `v1alpha1` policy

The `v1alpha1` RBAC policy (`ClusterRbacConfig`, `ServiceRole`, and
`ServiceRoleBinding`) is deprecated by the `v1beta1` authorization policy.

Istio 1.4 continues to support the `v1alpha1` RBAC policy to give you
enough time to move away from the alpha policies.

## Migration from the `v1alpha1` policy

Istio only supports one of the two versions for a given workload:

* If there is only `v1beta1` policy for a workload, the `v1beta1` policy
  will be used.
* If there is only `v1alpha1` policy for a workload, the `v1alpha1` policy
  will be used.
* If there are both `v1beta1` and `v1alpha1` policies for a workload,
  only the `v1beta1` policy will be used and the the `v1alpha1` policy
  will be ignored.

### General Guideline

{{< warning >}}
When migrating to use `v1beta1` policy for a given workload, make sure the
new `v1beta1` policy covers all the existing `v1alpha1` policies applied
for the workload, because the `v1alpha1` policies applied for the workload
will be ignored after you applied the `v1beta1` policies.
{{< /warning >}}

The typical flow of migrating to `v1beta1` policy is to start by checking the
`ClusterRbacConfig` to decide which namespace or service is enabled with RBAC.

For each service enabled with RBAC:

1. Get the workload selector from the service definition.
1. Create a `v1beta1` policy with the workload selector.
1. Update the `v1beta1` policy for each `ServiceRole` and `ServiceRoleBinding`
   applied to the service.
1. Apply the `v1beta1` policy and monitor the traffic to make sure the
   policy is working as expected.
1. Repeat the process for the next service enabled with RBAC.

For each namespace enabled with RBAC:

1. Apply a `v1beta1` policy that denies all traffic to the given namespace.

### Migration Example

Assume you have the following `v1alpha1` policies for the `httpbin` service
in the `foo` namespace:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ClusterRbacConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mode: 'ON_WITH_INCLUSION'
  inclusion:
    namespaces: ["foo"]
---
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRole
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: foo
spec:
  rules:
  - services: ["httpbin.foo.svc.cluster.local"]
    methods: ["GET"]
---
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: foo
spec:
  subjects:
  - user: "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep"
  roleRef:
    kind: ServiceRole
    name: "httpbin"
{{< /text >}}

Migrate the above policies to `v1beta1` in the following ways:

1. Assume the `httpbin` service has the following workload selector:

    {{< text yaml >}}
    selector:
      app: httpbin
      version: v1
    {{< /text >}}

1. Create a `v1beta1` policy with the workload selector:

    {{< text yaml >}}
    apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
    kind: AuthorizationPolicy
    metadata:
     name: httpbin
     namespace: foo
    spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: httpbin
         version: v1
    {{< /text >}}

1. Update the `v1beta1` policy with each `ServiceRole` and `ServiceRoleBinding`
applied to the service:

    {{< text yaml >}}
    apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
    kind: AuthorizationPolicy
    metadata:
     name: httpbin
     namespace: foo
    spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: httpbin
         version: v1
     rules:
     - from:
       - source:
           principals: ["cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep"]
       to:
       - operation:
           methods: ["GET"]
    {{< /text >}}

1. Apply the `v1beta1` policy and monitor the traffic to make sure it works
as expected.

1. Apply the following `v1beta1` policy that denies all traffic to the
`foo` namespace because the `foo` namespace is enabled with RBAC:

    {{< text yaml >}}
    apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
    kind: AuthorizationPolicy
    metadata:
     name: deny-all
     namespace: foo
    spec:
     {}
    {{< /text >}}

Make sure the `v1beta1` policy is working as expected and then you can delete
the `v1alpha1` policies from the cluster.

### Automation of the Migration

To help ease the migration, the `istioctl experimental authz convert`
command is provided to automatically convert the `v1alpha1` policies to
the `v1beta1` policy.

You can evaluate the command but it is experimental in Istio 1.4 and doesn't
support the full `v1alpha1` semantics as of the date of this blog post.

The command to support the full `v1alpha1` semantics is expected in a patch
release following Istio 1.4.
