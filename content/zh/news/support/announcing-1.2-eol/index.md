According to Istio's [support policy](/about/release-cadence/), LTS releases like 1.2 are supported for three months after the next LTS release. Since [1.3 was released on September 12th](/news/releases/1.3.x/announcing-1.3/), support for 1.2 will end on December 13th, 2019.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.2, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}).  If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
