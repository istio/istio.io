We're pleased to announce the availability of Istio 1.0.4. Please see below for what's changed.

{{< relnote >}}

## Known issues

- Pilot may deadlock when using [`istioctl proxy-status`](/zh/docs/reference/commands/istioctl/#istioctl-proxy-status) to get proxy synchronization status.
  The work around is to *not use* `istioctl proxy-status`.
  Once Pilot enters a deadlock, it exhibits continuous memory growth eventually running out of memory.

## Networking

- Fixed the lack of removal of stale endpoints causing `503` errors.

- Fixed sidecar injection when a pod label contains a `/`.

## Policy and telemetry

- Fixed occasional data corruption problem with out-of-process Mixer adapters leading to incorrect behavior.

- Fixed excessive CPU usage by Mixer when waiting for missing CRDs.
