{{< relnote >}}

## Bug fixes

- Prevent overly large strings from being sent to Prometheus ([Issue 14642](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14642)).
- Reuse previously cached JWT public keys if transport errors are encountered during renewal ([Issue 14638](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14638)).
- Bypass JWT authentication for HTTP OPTIONS methods to support CORS requests.
- Fix Envoy crash caused by the Mixer filter ([Issue 14707](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14707)).

## Small enhancements

- Expose cryptographic signature verification functions to `Lua` Envoy filters ([Envoy Issue 7009](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/7009)).
