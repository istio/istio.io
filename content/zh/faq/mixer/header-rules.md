title: Why does my rule not match?

Mixer rules must be valid to be applied at runtime. That means the match
conditions are well-defined expressions in the
[language](/zh/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/expression-language/), the attributes
are declared in an [attribute
manifest](/zh/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/attribute-vocabulary/), and rules have
no dangling references to handlers and instances.

The attribute values are typically normalized before evaluating rules on
them. For example, HTTP headers have lowercase keys in `request.headers` and
`response.headers` attributes. An expression
`request.headers["X-Forwarded-Proto"] == "http"` does not match any request
even though HTTP headers are case-insensitive. Instead, use an expression
`request.headers["x-forwarded-proto"] == "http"`.
