Learn how to implement a new adapter for Mixer by consulting the
[Adapter Developer's Guide](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Mixer-Compiled-In-Adapter-Dev-Guide).

Istio 1.0 introduces initial support for out-of-process adapters. This will
be the recommended approach moving forward for integrating with Mixer. Initial documentation on
how to build an out-of-process adapter is provided by the
[Out Of Process Adapter Dev Guide](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Mixer-Out-Of-Process-Adapter-Dev-Guide)
and the [Out of Process Adapter Walk-through](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Mixer-Out-Of-Process-Adapter-Walkthrough).
