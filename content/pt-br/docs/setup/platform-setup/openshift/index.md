{{< warning >}}
OpenShift 4.1 and above use `nftables`, which is incompatible with the Istio `proxy-init` container. Make sure to use [CNI](/pt-br/docs/setup/additional-setup/cni/) instead.
{{< /warning >}}

Follow these instructions to prepare an OpenShift cluster for Istio.

By default, OpenShift doesn't allow containers running with user ID 0.
You must enable containers running with UID 0 for Istio's service accounts
by running the command below. Make sure to replace `istio-system` if you are
deploying Istio in another namespace:

{{< text bash >}}
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}

Now you can install Istio using the [CNI](/pt-br/docs/setup/additional-setup/cni/) instructions.

After installation is complete, expose an OpenShift route for the ingress gateway.

{{< text bash >}}
$ oc -n istio-system expose svc/istio-ingressgateway --port=80

## Automatic sidecar injection

{{< tip >}}
This setup is not necessary if you are running OpenShift 4.1 or higher. If this is the case, skip to the next section.
{{< /tip >}}

Webhook and certificate signing requests support must be enabled for [automatic injection](/pt-br/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection) to work. Modify the master configuration file on the master node for the cluster as follows.

{{< tip >}}
By default, the master configuration file can be found in `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml`.
{{< /tip >}}

In the same directory as the master configuration file, create a file named `master-config.patch` with the following contents:

{{< text yaml >}}
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    MutatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
    ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
{{< /text >}}

In the same directory, execute:

{{< text bash >}}
$ cp -p master-config.yaml master-config.yaml.prepatch
$ oc ex config patch master-config.yaml.prepatch -p "$(cat master-config.patch)" > master-config.yaml
$ master-restart api
$ master-restart controllers
{{< /text >}}

## Privileged security context constraints for application sidecars

The Istio sidecar injected into each application pod runs with user ID 1337, which is not allowed by default in OpenShift. To allow this user ID to be used, execute the following commands. Replace `<target-namespace>` with the appropriate namespace.

{{< text bash >}}
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-group privileged system:serviceaccounts -n <target-namespace>
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts -n <target-namespace>
{{< /text >}}

When removing your application, remove the permissions as follows.

{{< text bash >}}
$ oc adm policy remove-scc-from-group privileged system:serviceaccounts -n <target-namespace>
$ oc adm policy remove-scc-from-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts -n <target-namespace>
{{< /text >}}
