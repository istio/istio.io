You can change mutual TLS settings for your services at any time using [authentication policy](/pt-br/docs/concepts/security/#authentication-policies)
and [destination rule](/pt-br/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#destination-rules). See [task](/pt-br/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy) for more details.
