We recommend starting with the [Guides](/docs/examples/), which walks
through different core Istio concepts in a tutorial style. The guides show
case intelligent routing, policy enforcement, security, telemetry, etc.

To start using Istio on your existing Kubernetes or Consul deployment, please refer to our [Installation instructions](/docs/setup/).
