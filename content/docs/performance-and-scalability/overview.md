The Performance and Scalability working group has a 4 pronged approach for Istio's performance characterization, tracking and improvements:

* Code level micro-benchmarks

* Synthetic end-to-end benchmarks across various scenarios

* Realistic complex app end-to-end benchmarks across various settings

* Automation to ensure performance doesn't regress

We also aim to provide guidance for sizing and configuration of Istio installation in production and how to ensure scalability.
