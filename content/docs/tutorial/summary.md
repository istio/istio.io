As you saw in the tutorial modules, Istio provides the following features:

* Managing traffic between microservices. With Istio you can perform canary deployments,
traffic shadowing, phased rollouts and A/B testing.
* Reporting and Monitoring. With Istio you can collect logs and metrics related to the traffic between your
microservices, monitor traffic by a dashboard, and examine distributed tracing.
* Microservice patterns. Fault injection, retries, timeouts, outlier detection.
* Traffic encryption.
* Security policies enforcement.

## Next steps to learn Istio

Istio provides many more features, not covered in this tutorial.
Note that [Istio can run on VMs](/docs/examples/integrating-vms).
Istio can be integrated with [service registries](/docs/setup/consul) other than Kubernetes.
Istio can [control the traffic from the outside into the service mesh](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress)
and [the traffic to external services](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress).

And, last but not least, Istio can be used to
[connect applications in multiple clusters](/docs/concepts/multicluster-deployments/).

See more tasks, examples and blog posts at [istio.io](/).
