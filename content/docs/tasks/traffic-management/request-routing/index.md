> This task uses the new [v1alpha3 traffic management API](/blog/2018/v1alpha3-routing/). The old API has been deprecated and will be removed in the next Istio release. If you need to use the old version, follow the docs [here](https://archive.istio.io/v0.7/docs/tasks/traffic-management/).

This task shows you how to route requests dynamically to multiple versions of a
microservice.

## Before you begin

* Setup Istio by following the instructions in the
[Installation guide](/docs/setup/).

* Deploy the [Bookinfo](/docs/examples/bookinfo/) sample application.

* Review the [Traffic Management](/docs/concepts/traffic-management) concepts doc. Before attempting this task, you should be familiar with important terms such as *destination rule*, *virtual service*, and *subset*.

## About this task

The Istio [Bookinfo](/docs/examples/bookinfo/) sample consists of four separate microservices, each with multiple versions. The initial goal of this task is to
apply a rule that routes all traffic to `v1` (version 1) of the ratings service. Later, you
will apply a rule to route traffic based on the value of an HTTP request header.

To illustrate the problem this task solves, access the Bookinfo app's `/productpage` in a browser and refresh several times. Youâ€™ll notice that sometimes the book review output contains star ratings and other times it does not. This is because without an explicit default service version to route to, Istio routes requests to all available versions
in a round robin fashion.

## Apply a default destination rule

To route to one version only, you start by applying destination rules. Destination rules define traffic policies that Istio applies to requests. Destination rules also let you define which versions of the destination host are addressable. These addressable versions are called *subsets*.

1.  Run the following command to apply a default destination rule:

    If you did **not** enable mutual TLS, execute this command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl create -f @samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

    If you **did** enable mutual TLS, execute this command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl create -f @samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

    Wait a few seconds for the destination rules to propagate.

1. Display the destination rules with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl get destinationrules -o yaml
    {{< /text >}}

    In the next step, you will add virtual services that refer to the subsets
    defined in the rules.

## Apply a virtual service

Next, apply a virtual service to set the default version for all of the microservices.
In this case, the virtual service routes all traffic to `v1` of each microservice.

 > Before continuing, be sure you don't have any existing virtual services applied
to the Bookinfo app. If you already created conflicting virtual services for Bookinfo, you must use `replace` rather than `create` in the following command.

1.  Run the following command to apply the virtual service:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl create -f @samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

    In a Kubernetes deployment of Istio, you can replace `istioctl` with `kubectl` in
    the above, and for all other CLI commands. Note, however, that `kubectl` currently
    does not provide input validation.

    Because configuration propagation is eventually consistent, wait a few seconds
    for the virtual services to take effect.

1. Display the defined routes with the following command:

    {{< text bash yaml >}}
    $ istioctl get virtualservices -o yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: details
      ...
    spec:
      hosts:
      - details
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: details
            subset: v1
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: productpage
      ...
    spec:
      gateways:
      - bookinfo-gateway
      - mesh
      hosts:
      - productpage
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: productpage
            subset: v1
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: ratings
      ...
    spec:
      hosts:
      - ratings
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: ratings
            subset: v1
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: reviews
      ...
    spec:
      hosts:
      - reviews
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
    ---
    {{< /text >}}

1. Display the corresponding `subset` definitions:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl get destinationrules -o yaml
    {{< /text >}}

You have configured Istio to route to the `v1` version of the Bookinfo microservices,
including the `ratings` service.

## Test the new routing configuration

You can easily test the new configuration by once again refreshing the `/productpage`
of the Bookinfo app.

1.  Open the Bookinfo site in your browser. The URL is `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage`, where `$GATEWAY_URL` is the External IP address of the ingress, as explained in
the [Bookinfo](/docs/examples/bookinfo/#determining-the-ingress-ip-and-port) doc.

    Notice that the reviews part of the page displays with no rating stars, no
    matter how many times you refresh. This is because you configured Istio to route
    all traffic for the reviews service to the version `reviews:v1` and this
    version of the service does not access the star ratings service.

You have successfully accomplished the first part of this task: route traffic to one
version of a service.

## Route based on user identity

Next, you will change the route config so that all traffic from a specific user
is routed to a specific service version. In this case, all traffic from a user
named Jason will be routed to the service `reviews:v2`.

Remember, `reviews:v2` is the version that includes the star ratings feature.

1. Run the following command to enable the user-based routing:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl replace -f @samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

1. Confirm the rule is created:

    {{< text bash yaml >}}
    $ istioctl get virtualservice reviews -o yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: reviews
      ...
    spec:
      hosts:
      - reviews
      http:
      - match:
        - headers:
            cookie:
              regex: ^(.*?;)?(user=jason)(;.*)?$
        route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v2
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
    {{< /text >}}

1.  On the `/productpage` of the Bookinfo app, log in as user `jason`.

    Refresh the browser. What do you see? The star ratings appear next to each
    review.

1. Log in as another user (pick any name you wish).

    Refresh the browser. Now the stars are gone. This is because traffic is routed
    to `reviews:v1` for all users except Jason.

You have successfully configured Istio to route traffic based on user identity.

## Understanding what happened

In this task, you used Istio to send 100% of the traffic to the `v1` version
of each of the Bookinfo services. You then set a rule to selectively send traffic
to version `v2` of the reviews service based on a header (a user cookie) present in
the request.

Note that Kubernetes services, like the Bookinfo ones used in this task, must
adhere to certain restrictions to take advantage of Istio's L7 routing features.
Refer to the [sidecar injection documentation](/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection/#pod-spec-requirements) for details.

In the [traffic shifting](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/traffic-shifting) task, you
will follow the same basic pattern you learned here to configure route rules to
gradually send traffic from one version of a service to another.

## Cleanup

1.   Remove the application virtual services.

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl delete -f @samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

1.   Remove the application destination rules.

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl delete -f @samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

    If you enabled mutual TLS, please run the following instead

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl delete -f @samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

1. If you are not planning to explore any follow-on tasks, refer to the
  [Bookinfo cleanup](/docs/examples/bookinfo/#cleanup) instructions
  to shutdown the application.
