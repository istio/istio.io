---

The [Control Egress Traffic](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress/) task demonstrates how external (outside the Kubernetes cluster) HTTP and HTTPS services can be accessed from applications inside the mesh. A quick reminder: by default, Istio-enabled applications are unable to access URLs outside the cluster. To enable such access, a [service entry](/docs/reference/config/istio.networking.v1alpha3/#ServiceEntry) for the external service must be defined, or, alternatively, [direct access to external services](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress/#calling-external-services-directly) must be configured.

The [TLS Origination for Egress Traffic](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress-tls-origination/) task demonstrates how to allow the applications to send HTTP requests to external servers that require HTTPS.

This task describes how to configure Istio to direct the egress traffic through a dedicated service called _Egress Gateway_. We achieve the same functionality as described in the [TLS Origination for Egress Traffic](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress-tls-origination/) task, only this time we accomplish it with the addition of an egress gateway.

## Use case

Consider an organization that has strict security requirements. According to these requirements all the traffic that leaves the service mesh must flow through a set of dedicated nodes. These nodes will run on dedicated machines, separately from the rest of the nodes used for running applications in the cluster. The special nodes will serve for policy enforcement on the egress traffic and will be monitored more thoroughly than the rest of the nodes.

Istio 0.8 introduced the concept of [ingress and egress gateways](/docs/reference/config/istio.networking.v1alpha3/#Gateway). Ingress gateways allow one to define entrance points into the service mesh that all incoming traffic flows through. _Egress gateway_ is a symmetrical concept, it defines exit points for the mesh. An egress gateway allows Istio features, for example, monitoring and route rules, to be applied to traffic exiting the mesh.

Another use case is a cluster where the application nodes do not have public IPs, so the in-mesh services that run on them cannot access the Internet. Defining an egress gateway, directing all the egress traffic through it and allocating public IPs to the egress gateway nodes allows the application nodes to access external services in a controlled way.

## Before you begin

* Setup Istio by following the instructions in the
  [Installation guide](/docs/setup/).

*   Start the [sleep]({{< github_tree >}}/samples/sleep) sample
    which will be used as a test source for external calls.

    If you have enabled [automatic sidecar injection](/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection), do

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/sleep/sleep.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

    otherwise, you have to manually inject the sidecar before deploying the `sleep` application:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f @samples/sleep/sleep.yaml@)
    {{< /text >}}

    Note that any pod that you can `exec` and `curl` from would do.

*   Create a shell variable to hold the name of the source pod for sending requests to external services.
If we used the [sleep]({{<github_tree>}}/samples/sleep) sample, we run:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ export SOURCE_POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})
    {{< /text >}}

## Define an egress `Gateway` and direct HTTP traffic through it

First direct HTTP traffic without TLS origination

1.  Define a `ServiceEntry` for `edition.cnn.com`:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: ServiceEntry
    metadata:
      name: cnn
    spec:
      hosts:
      - edition.cnn.com
      ports:
      - number: 80
        name: http-port
        protocol: HTTP
      - number: 443
        name: https
        protocol: HTTPS
      resolution: DNS
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Verify that your `ServiceEntry` was applied correctly. Send an HTTPS request to [http://edition.cnn.com/politics](http://edition.cnn.com/politics).

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec -it $SOURCE_POD -c sleep -- curl -sL -o /dev/null -D - http://edition.cnn.com/politics
    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    ...
    location: https://edition.cnn.com/politics
    ...

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    ...
    Content-Length: 151654
    ...
    {{< /text >}}

    The output should be the same as in the
    [TLS Origination for Egress Traffic](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress-tls-origination/) task, without TLS
    origination.

1.  Create an egress `Gateway` for _edition.cnn.com_, port 80.

    If you have [mutual TLS Authentication](/docs/tasks/security/mutual-tls/) enabled in Istio, use the following
    command. Note that in addition to creating a `Gateway`, it creates a `DestinationRule` to specify mutual TLS to the egress
    gateway, setting SNI to `edition.cnn.com`.

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      name: istio-egressgateway
    spec:
      selector:
        istio: egressgateway
      servers:
      - port:
          number: 80
          name: https
          protocol: HTTPS
        hosts:
        - edition.cnn.com
        tls:
          mode: MUTUAL
          serverCertificate: /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem
          privateKey: /etc/certs/key.pem
          caCertificates: /etc/certs/root-cert.pem
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: DestinationRule
    metadata:
      name: set-sni-for-egress-gateway
    spec:
      host: istio-egressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
      trafficPolicy:
        loadBalancer:
          simple: ROUND_ROBIN
        portLevelSettings:
        - port:
            number: 80
          tls:
            mode: MUTUAL
            clientCertificate: /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem
            privateKey: /etc/certs/key.pem
            caCertificates: /etc/certs/root-cert.pem
            subjectAltNames:
            - spiffe://cluster.local/ns/istio-system/sa/istio-egressgateway-service-account
            sni: edition.cnn.com
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

    otherwise:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      name: istio-egressgateway
    spec:
      selector:
        istio: egressgateway
      servers:
      - port:
          number: 80
          name: http
          protocol: HTTP
        hosts:
        - edition.cnn.com
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Define a `VirtualService` to direct the traffic through the egress gateway:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: direct-through-egress-gateway
    spec:
      hosts:
      - edition.cnn.com
      gateways:
      - istio-egressgateway
      - mesh
      http:
      - match:
        - gateways:
          - mesh
          port: 80
        route:
        - destination:
            host: istio-egressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
            port:
              number: 80
          weight: 100
      - match:
        - gateways:
          - istio-egressgateway
          port: 80
        route:
        - destination:
            host: edition.cnn.com
            port:
              number: 80
          weight: 100
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Resend the HTTP request to [http://edition.cnn.com/politics](https://edition.cnn.com/politics).

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec -it $SOURCE_POD -c sleep -- curl -sL -o /dev/null -D - http://edition.cnn.com/politics
    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    ...
    location: https://edition.cnn.com/politics
    ...

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    ...
    Content-Length: 151654
    ...
    {{< /text >}}

    The output should be the same as in the step 2.

1.  Check the log of the `istio-egressgateway` pod and see a line corresponding to our request. If Istio is deployed in the `istio-system` namespace, the command to print the log is:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl logs $(kubectl get pod -l istio=egressgateway -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') egressgateway -n istio-system | tail
    {{< /text >}}

    We should see a line related to our request, similar to the following:

    {{< text plain >}}
    [2018-06-14T11:46:23.596Z] "GET /politics HTTP/1.1" 301 - 0 0 3 1 "172.30.146.87" "curl/7.35.0" "ab7be694-e367-94c5-83d1-086eca996dae" "edition.cnn.com" "151.101.193.67:80"
    {{< /text >}}

    Note that we redirected only the traffic from the port 80 to the egress gateway, the HTTPS traffic to the port 443 went directly to _edition.cnn.com_.

### Cleanup of the egress gateway for HTTP traffic

Remove the previous definitions before proceeding to the next step:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl delete gateway istio-egressgateway
$ kubectl delete serviceentry cnn
$ kubectl delete virtualservice direct-through-egress-gateway
$ kubectl delete destinationrule set-sni-for-egress-gateway
{{< /text >}}

## Perform TLS origination with the egress `Gateway`

Let's perform TLS origination with the egress `Gateway`, similar to the [TLS Origination for Egress Traffic](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress-tls-origination/) task.  Note that in this case the TLS origination will be done by the egress Gateway server, as opposed to by the sidecar in the previous task.

1.  Define a `ServiceEntry` for `edition.cnn.com`:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: ServiceEntry
    metadata:
      name: cnn
    spec:
      hosts:
      - edition.cnn.com
      ports:
      - number: 80
        name: http-port
        protocol: HTTP
      - number: 443
        name: http-port-for-tls-origination
        protocol: HTTP
      resolution: DNS
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Verify that your `ServiceEntry` was applied correctly. Send an HTTPS request to [http://edition.cnn.com/politics](https://edition.cnn.com/politics).

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec -it $SOURCE_POD -c sleep -- curl -sL -o /dev/null -D - http://edition.cnn.com/politics
    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    ...
    location: https://edition.cnn.com/politics
    ...

    command terminated with exit code 35
    {{< /text >}}

    The output should be contain _301 Moved Permanently_, if you see it, your `ServiceEntry` was configured correctly.
    The exit code _35_ is due to the fact that Istio did not perform TLS origination. The egress gateway will perform
    TLS origination, proceed to the following steps to configure it.

1.  Create an egress `Gateway` for _edition.cnn.com_, port 443.

    If you have [mutual TLS Authentication](/docs/tasks/security/mutual-tls/) enabled in Istio, use the following
    command. Note that in addition to creating a `Gateway`, it creates a `DestinationRule` to specify mutual TLS to the egress
    gateway, setting SNI to `edition.cnn.com`.

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3

            sni: edition.cnn.com
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

    otherwise:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3

          protocol: HTTP
        hosts:
        - edition.cnn.com
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Define a `VirtualService` to direct the traffic through the egress gateway, and a `DestinationRule` to perform TLS
    origination:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3

      - match:
        - gateways:
          - mesh
          port: 80
        route:
        - destination:
            host: istio-egressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
            port:
              number: 443
          weight: 100
      - match:
        - gateways:
          - istio-egressgateway
          port: 443
        route:
        - destination:
            host: edition.cnn.com
            port:
              number: 443

    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Send an HTTP request to [http://edition.cnn.com/politics](https://edition.cnn.com/politics).

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec -it $SOURCE_POD -c sleep -- curl -sL -o /dev/null -D - http://edition.cnn.com/politics
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ...
    content-length: 150793
    ...
    {{< /text >}}

    The output should be the same as in the [TLS Origination for Egress Traffic](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress-tls-origination/) task, with TLS origination: without the _301 Moved Permanently_ message.

1.  Check the log of the `istio-egressgateway` pod and see a line corresponding to our request. If Istio is deployed in the `istio-system` namespace, the command to print the log is:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl logs $(kubectl get pod -l istio=egressgateway -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') egressgateway -n istio-system | tail
    {{< /text >}}

    We should see a line related to our request, similar to the following:

    {{< text plain>}}

    {{< /text >}}

### Cleanup of the egress gateway for TLS origination

Remove the Istio configuration items we created:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl delete gateway istio-egressgateway
$ kubectl delete serviceentry cnn
$ kubectl delete virtualservice direct-through-egress-gateway
$ kubectl delete destinationrule originate-tls-for-edition-cnn-com
$ kubectl delete destinationrule set-sni-for-egress-gateway
{{< /text >}}

## Direct HTTPS traffic through an egress gateway

In this section you direct HTTPS traffic (TLS originated by the application) through an egress gateway.
You specify the port 443, protocol `TLS` in the corresponding `ServiceEntry`, egress `Gateway` and `VirtualService`.

1.  Define a `ServiceEntry` for `edition.cnn.com`:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: ServiceEntry
    metadata:
      name: cnn
    spec:
      hosts:
      - edition.cnn.com
      ports:
      - number: 443
        name: tls
        protocol: TLS
      resolution: DNS
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Verify that your `ServiceEntry` was applied correctly. Send an HTTPS request to [http://edition.cnn.com/politics](https://edition.cnn.com/politics).
The output should be the same as in the previous section.

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec -it $SOURCE_POD -c sleep -- curl -sL -o /dev/null -D - https://edition.cnn.com/politics

    Content-Length: 151654
    ...
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Create an egress `Gateway` for _edition.cnn.com_, port 443, protocol TLS.

    If you have [mutual TLS Authentication](/docs/tasks/security/mutual-tls/) enabled in Istio, use the following
    command. Note that in addition to creating a `Gateway`, it creates a `DestinationRule` to specify mutual TLS to the egress
    gateway, setting SNI to `edition.cnn.com`.

1.  Send an HTTPS request to [http://edition.cnn.com/politics](https://edition.cnn.com/politics). The output should be the same as previously.

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec -it $SOURCE_POD -c sleep -- curl -sL -o /dev/null -D - https://edition.cnn.com/politics
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    ...
    Content-Length: 151654

1.  Check the statistics of the egress gateway's proxy and see a counter that corresponds to our
    requests to _edition.cnn.com_. If Istio is deployed in the `istio-system` namespace, the command to print the
    counter is:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l istio=egressgateway -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -c egressgateway -n istio-system -- curl -s localhost:15000/stats | grep edition.cnn.com.upstream_cx_total
    cluster.outbound|443||edition.cnn.com.upstream_cx_total: 1
    {{< /text >}}

    You may want to perform a couple of additional requests and verify that the counter above grows by 1 with each
    request.

### Cleanup of the egress gateway for HTTPS traffic

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl delete serviceentry cnn
$ kubectl delete gateway istio-egressgateway
$ kubectl delete virtualservice direct-through-egress-gateway
$ kubectl delete destinationrule set-sni-for-egress-gateway
{{< /text >}}

## Additional security considerations

Note that defining an egress `Gateway` in Istio does not in itself provides any special treatment for the nodes on which the egress gateway service runs. It is up to the cluster administrator or the cloud provider to deploy the egress gateways on dedicated nodes and to introduce additional security measures to make these nodes more secure than the rest of the mesh.

Also note that Istio itself *cannot securely enforce* that all the egress traffic will actually flow through the egress gateways, Istio only *enables* such flow by its sidecar proxies. If a malicious application would attack the sidecar proxy attached to the application's pod, it could bypass the sidecar proxy. Having bypassed the sidecar proxy, the malicious application could try to exit the service mesh bypassing the egress gateway, to escape the control and monitoring by Istio. It is up to the cluster administrator or the cloud provider to enforce that no traffic leaves the mesh bypassing the egress gateway. Such enforcement must be performed by mechanisms external to Istio. For example, a firewall can deny all the traffic whose source is not the egress gateway. [Kubernetes network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) can also forbid all the egress traffic that does not originate in the egress gateway. Another possible security measure involves configuring the network in such a way that the application nodes are unable to access the Internet without directing the egress traffic through the gateway where it will be monitored and controlled. One example of such network configuration is allocating public IPs exclusively to the gateways.

## Troubleshooting

1.  Check if you have [mutual TLS Authentication](/docs/tasks/security/mutual-tls/) enabled in Istio, following the
steps in
[Verifying Istio’s mutual TLS authentication setup](/docs/tasks/security/mutual-tls/#verifying-istio-s-mutual-tls-authentication-setup).
If mutual TLS is enabled, make sure you create the configuration
items accordingly (note the remarks _If you have mutual TLS Authentication enabled in Istio, you must create..._).

1.  If [mutual TLS Authentication](/docs/tasks/security/mutual-tls/) is enabled, verify the correct certificate of the
    egress gateway:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec -i -n istio-system $(kubectl get pod -l istio=egressgateway -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')  -- cat /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem | openssl x509 -text -noout  | grep 'Subject Alternative Name' -A 1
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
                URI:spiffe://cluster.local/ns/istio-system/sa/istio-egressgateway-service-account

## Cleanup

Shutdown the [sleep]({{<github_tree>}}/samples/sleep) service:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl delete -f @samples/sleep/sleep.yaml@
{{< /text >}}
