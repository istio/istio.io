This task shows you how to generate a graph of services within an Istio mesh.
As part of this task, you will install the Servicegraph addon and use
the web-based interface for viewing service graph of the service mesh.

The [Bookinfo]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html) sample application is used as
the example application throughout this task.

## Before you begin

* [Install Istio]({{home}}/docs/setup/) in your cluster and deploy an
  application.

## Generating a Service Graph

1.  To view a graphical representation of your service mesh, install the
    Servicegraph add-on.

    In Kubernetes environments, execute the following command:

    ```command
    $ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/addons/servicegraph.yaml
    ```

1.  Verify that the service is running in your cluster.

    In Kubernetes environments, execute the following command:

    ```command
    $ kubectl -n istio-system get svc servicegraph
    NAME           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
    servicegraph   10.59.253.165   <none>        8088/TCP   30s
    ```

1.  Send traffic to the mesh.

    For the Bookinfo sample, visit `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage` in your web
    browser or issue the following command:

    ```command
    $ curl http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
    ```

    Refresh the page a few times (or send the command a few times) to generate a
    small amount of traffic.

    > `$GATEWAY_URL` is the value set in the [Bookinfo]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html) guide.

1.  Open the Servicegraph UI.

    In Kubernetes environments, execute the following command:

    ```command
    $ kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=servicegraph -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8088:8088 &
    ```

    Visit [http://localhost:8088/force/forcegraph.html](http://localhost:8088/force/forcegraph.html)
    in your web browser. Try clicking on a service to see details on
    the service. Real time traffic data is shown in a panel below.

    The results will look similar to:

    {% include image.html width="75%" ratio="107.7%"
    link="./img/servicegraph-example.png"
    caption="Example Servicegraph"
    %}

1.  Experiment with Query Parameters

    Visit
    [http://localhost:8088/force/forcegraph.html?time_horizon=15s&filter_empty=true](http://localhost:8088/force/forcegraph.html?time_horizon=15s&filter_empty=true)
    in your web browser. Note the query parameters provided.

    `filter_empty=true` will only show services that are currently receiving traffic within the time horizon.

    `time_horizon=15s` affects the filter above, and also affects the
    reported traffic information when clicking on a service. The
    traffic information will be aggregated over the specified time
    horizon.

    The default behavior is to not filter empty services, and use a
    time horizon of 5 minutes.

### About the Servicegraph add-on

The [Servicegraph](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/addons/servicegraph)
service provides endpoints for generating and visualizing a graph of
services within a mesh. It exposes the following endpoints:

* `/force/forcegraph.html` As explored above, this is an interactive
  [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) visualization.

* `/dotviz` is a static [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/)
  visualization.

* `/dotgraph` provides a
  [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language))
  serialization.

* `/d3graph` provides a JSON serialization for D3 visualization.

* `/graph` provides a generic JSON serialization.

All endpoints take the query parameters explored above.

The Servicegraph example is built on top of Prometheus queries and
depends on the standard Istio metric configuration.

## Cleanup

*   In Kubernetes environments, execute the following command to remove the
Servicegraph add-on:

    ```command
    $ kubectl delete -f install/kubernetes/addons/servicegraph.yaml
    ```

* If you are not planning to explore any follow-on tasks, refer to the
[Bookinfo cleanup]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html#cleanup) instructions
to shutdown the application.
