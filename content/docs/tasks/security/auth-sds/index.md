This task shows how to enable [SDS (secret discovery service)](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/secret#config-secret-discovery-service) for Istio identity provisioning.

Prior to Istio 1.1, the keys and certificates of Istio workloads were generated by Citadel and distributed to sidecars
through secret-volume mounted files, this approach has the following minor drawbacks:

* Performance regression during certificate rotation:
  When certificate rotation happens, Envoy performs a hot restart to pick up the new key and certificate causing the performance regression.
  which causes performance regression.

* Potential security vulnerabilities:
  Citadel distributes the workload private keys through Kubernetes secrets, which have known
  [risks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks). Storing the private key in the pod local file system can cause additional vulnerabilities

The SDS identity provision flow addresses these issues:

The workload sidecar Envoy requests key and certificates from the Citadel Agent (SDS server, which runs as per-node `DaemonSet`) using a Kubernetes
service account JWT through the SDS API.
The Citadel Agent generates a key pair and sends the CSR request to Citadel. Citadel verifies the JWT and issues the certificate to the Citadel Agent.
Eventually, Citadel Agent sends the key and certificate back to the workload sidecar.
In this approach, the private key never leaves the node; it is only kept in the Citadel Agent and Envoy sidecar's memory.
Thus, this approach is more secure than the secret volume mount approach, which relies on the secret and local files on pod.
Also, the sidecar Envoy is able to dynamically renew the key and certificate through the SDS API, so restarting Envoy can be avoided.

## Before you begin

* Set up Istio by following the instructions using [Helm](/docs/setup/kubernetes/helm-install/) with SDS setup and global mutual TLS enabled:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ cat install/kubernetes/namespace.yaml > istio-auth-sds.yaml
    $ cat install/kubernetes/helm/istio-init/files/crd-* >> istio-auth-sds.yaml
    $ helm dep update --skip-refresh install/kubernetes/helm/istio
    $ helm template install/kubernetes/helm/istio --name istio --namespace istio-system --values install/kubernetes/helm/istio/values-istio-sds-auth.yaml >> istio-auth-sds.yaml
    $ kubectl create -f istio-auth-sds.yaml
    {{< /text >}}

## Service-to-service mutual TLS using key/certificate provisioned through SDS

Follow the [authentication policy task](/docs/tasks/security/authn-policy/) to setup test services.

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl create ns foo
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml) -n foo
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/sleep/sleep.yaml) -n foo
$ ubectl create ns bar
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml) -n bar
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/sleep/sleep.yaml) -n bar
{{< /text >}}

Verify all mutual TLS requests succeed:

{{< text bash >}}
$ for from in "foo" "bar"; do for to in "foo" "bar"; do kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n ${from} -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c sleep -n ${from} -- curl "http://httpbin.${to}:8000/ip" -s -o /dev/null -w "sleep.${from} to httpbin.${to}: %{http_code}\n"; done; done
sleep.foo to httpbin.foo: 200
sleep.foo to httpbin.bar: 200
sleep.bar to httpbin.foo: 200
sleep.bar to httpbin.bar: 200
{{< /text >}}

## Verifying no secret-volume mounted file is generated

Verify no secret-volume mounted file is generated by remotely accessing to workload sidecar container that we just deployed:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n foo -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -n foo  -- /bin/bash
{{< /text >}}

As you can see there is no secret file mounted at `/etc/certs` folder.

## Cleanup

Clean up test services and Istio control plane:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl delete ns foo
$ kubectl delete ns bar
$ kubectl delete -f istio-auth-sds.yaml
{{< /text >}}

## Caveats

Currently, the SDS identity provision flow has the following caveats:

* The control plane security has to be turned off. Enabling SDS with control plane security turned on is working in progress.

* The support clusters smoothly migrating from using the secret volume mount to using the SDS is working in progress.
