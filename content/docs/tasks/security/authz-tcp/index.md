This task covers the activities you might need to perform to set up Istio authorization, also known
as Istio Role Based Access Control (RBAC), for TCP services in an Istio mesh. You can read more in
[authorization](/docs/concepts/security/#authorization) and get started with a basic tutorial in
Istio Security Basics.

## Before you begin

The activities in this task assume that you:

* Understand [authorization](/docs/concepts/security/#authorization) concepts.

* Have set up Istio on Kubernetes **with authentication enabled** by following the instructions in the
  [quick start](/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start/), this tutorial requires mutual TLS to work. Mutual TLS
  authentication should be enabled in the [installation steps](/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start/#installation-steps).

## Setup Bookinfo with MongoDB TCP service

The normal Bookinfo sample includes only HTTP services by default, in order to demonstrate Istio
authorization for TCP services, we'll update the Bookinfo sample to use the `v2` of the `ratings`
service which talks to a MongoDB backend.

> If you are using a namespace other than `default`, use `kubectl -n namespace ...` to specify the namespace.

1. Deploy the [Bookinfo](/docs/examples/bookinfo/) sample application

    After it has been deployed, point your browser at the Bookinfo `productpage` (`http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage`). You should see:

        * The "Book Details" section in the lower left part of the page, including type, pages, publisher, etc.
        * The "Book Reviews" section in the lower right part of the page.

    If you refresh the page several times, you should see different versions of reviews shown in the
    product page, presented in a round robin style (red stars, black stars, no stars)

1. Install `v2` of the `ratings` service with service account `bookinfo-ratings-v2`

    In this task, we will enable access control using service accounts, which are cryptographically
    authenticated in the mesh. In order to give different microservices different access privileges,
    we will create the `v2` of the `ratings` with service account `bookinfo-ratings-v2`. Other services
    will have a default service account `default`.

    If you are using a cluster with automatic sidecar injection enabled,
    simply deploy the service using `kubectl`:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/rbac/ratings-v2-add-serviceaccount.yaml@
    serviceaccount "bookinfo-ratings-v2" created
    deployment "ratings-v2" configured
    {{< /text >}}

    If you are using manual sidecar injection, use the following command instead:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/rbac/ratings-v2-add-serviceaccount.yaml@)
    serviceaccount "bookinfo-ratings-v2" created
    deployment "ratings-v2" configured
    {{< /text >}}

1. Update the Bookinfo sample to use the new version of `ratings`

    The Bookinfo sample deploys multiple versions of each microservice, so you will start by creating
    destination rules that define the service subsets corresponding to each version, and the load
    balancing policy for each subset.

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml@
    destinationrule "productpage" created
    destinationrule "reviews" created
    destinationrule "ratings" created
    destinationrule "details" created
    {{< /text >}}

    Since the subset referenced in virtual services rely on the destination rules,
    wait a few seconds for destination rules to propagate before adding virtual services that refer
    to these subsets.

    Update the `reviews` service to only use the `v2` of `ratings` service with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-ratings-db.yaml@
    virtualservice "reviews" created
    virtualservice "ratings" created
    {{< /text >}}

    Point your browser at the Bookinfo `productpage` (`http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage`). You should see:

       * The "Book Details" section in the lower left part of the page, including type, pages, publisher, etc.
       * The "Book Reviews" section in the lower right part of the page with "Ratings service is currently unavailable",
         This is because we switched to use `v2` of `ratings` but haven't deployed the mongoDB service.

1. Deploy the mongoDB service

    If you are using a cluster with automatic sidecar injection enabled,
    simply deploy the services using `kubectl`:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo-db.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

    If you are using manual sidecar injection, use the following command instead:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo-db.yaml@)
    service "mongodb" configured
    deployment "mongodb-v1" configured
    {{< /text >}}

    Point your browser at the Bookinfo `productpage` (`http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage`). You should see:

       * The "Book Details" section in the lower left part of the page, including type, pages, publisher, etc.
       * The "Book Reviews" section in the lower right part of the page with red stars.

## Enabling Istio authorization

Run the following command to enable Istio authorization for the `mongodb` service:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl apply -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/rbac/rbac-config-on-mongodb.yaml@
{{< /text >}}

Point your browser at the Bookinfo `productpage` (`http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage`).  You should see:

* The "Book Details" section in the lower left part of the page, including type, pages, publisher, etc.
* The "Book Reviews" section in the lower right part of the page with "Ratings service is currently unavailable".

This is because Istio authorization is "deny by default", which means that you need to explicitly
define access control policies to grant access to the `mongodb` service.

> There may be some delays due to caching and other propagation overhead.

## Service-level access control

Now let's set up service-level access control using Istio authorization to allow `v2` of `ratings`
to access the mongoDB service.

1. Run the following command to apply the authorization policy:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/rbac/mongodb-policy.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

    The step above does the following:

    * Creates a `ServiceRole` "mongodb-viewer" which allows access to the port 27017 of `mongodb` service.

        {{< text yaml >}}
        apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
        kind: ServiceRole
        metadata:
          name: mongodb-viewer
          namespace: default
        spec:
          rules:
          - services: ["mongodb.default.svc.cluster.local"]
            constraints:
            - key: "destination.port"
              values: ["27017"]
        {{< /text >}}

    * Creates a `ServiceRoleBinding` `bind-mongodb-viewer` which assigns the "mongodb-viewer" role to "bookinfo-ratings-v2".

        {{< text yaml >}}
        apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
        kind: ServiceRoleBinding
        metadata:
          name: bind-mongodb-viewer
          namespace: default
        spec:
          subjects:
          - user: "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-ratings-v2"
          roleRef:
            kind: ServiceRole
            name: "mongodb-viewer"
        {{< /text >}}

    Point your browser at the Bookinfo `productpage` (`http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage`).  You should see:

    * The "Book Details" section in the lower left part of the page, including type, pages, publisher, etc.
    * The "Book Reviews" section in the lower right part of the page with red stars again.

    > There may be some delays due to caching and other propagation overhead.

1. To confirm the mongoDB service can only be accessed by service account `bookinfo-ratings-v2`

    Run the following command to re-deploy the `v2` of `ratings` with service account `default`:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl delete -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/rbac/ratings-v2-add-serviceaccount.yaml@
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo-ratings-v2.yaml@
    serviceaccount "bookinfo-ratings-v2" deleted
    deployment "ratings-v2" deleted
    deployment "ratings-v2" created
    {{< /text >}}

    Point your browser at the Bookinfo `productpage` (`http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage`).  You should see:

    * The "Book Details" section in the lower left part of the page, including type, pages, publisher, etc.
    * The "Book Reviews" section in the lower right part of the page with "Ratings service is currently unavailable".

    > There may be some delays due to caching and other propagation overhead.

## Cleanup

*   Remove Istio authorization policy configuration:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl delete -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/rbac/mongodb-policy.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}

    Alternatively, you can delete all `ServiceRole` and `ServiceRoleBinding` resources by running the following commands:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl delete servicerole --all
    $ kubectl delete servicerolebinding --all
    {{< /text >}}

*   Disable Istio authorization:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl delete -f @samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/rbac/rbac-config-on-mongodb.yaml@
    {{< /text >}}
