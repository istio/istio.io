Istio aims to enhance the security of microservices and their communication without requiring service code changes. It is responsible for:

* Providing each service with a strong identity that represents its role to enable interoperability across clusters and clouds

* Securing service to service communication and end-user to service communication

* Providing a key management system to automate key and certificate generation, distribution, rotation, and revocation

The diagram below shows Istio's security-related architecture, which includes three primary components: identity, key management, and communication
security. This diagram describes how Istio is used to secure the service-to-service communication between service 'frontend' running
as the service account 'frontend-team' and service 'backend' running as the service account 'backend-team'. Istio supports services running
on both Kubernetes containers and VM/bare-metal machines.

As illustrated in the diagram, Istio leverages secret volume mount to deliver keys/certs from Citadel to Kubernetes containers. For services running on
VM/bare-metal machines, we introduce a node agent, which is a process running on each VM/bare-metal machine. It generates the private key and CSR (certificate
signing request) locally, sends CSR to Citadel for signing, and delivers the generated certificate together with the private key to Envoy.

## Mutual TLS Authentication

### Identity

Istio uses [Kubernetes service accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) to identify who runs the service:

*   A service account in Istio has the format "spiffe://\<_domain_\>/ns/\<_namespace_>/sa/\<_serviceaccount_\>".

    * _domain_ is currently _cluster.local_. We will support customization of domain in the near future.
    * _namespace_ is the namespace of the Kubernetes service account.
    * _serviceaccount_ is the Kubernetes service account name.

*   A service account is **the identity (or role) a workload runs as**, which represents that workload's privileges. For systems requiring strong security, the
amount of privilege for a workload should not be identified by a random string (i.e., service name, label, etc), or by the binary that is deployed.

    * For example, let's say we have a workload pulling data from a multi-tenant database. If Alice ran this workload, she will be able to pull
    a different set of data than if Bob ran this workload.

* Service accounts enable strong security policies by offering the flexibility to identify a machine, a user, a workload, or a group of workloads (different
workloads can run as the same service account).

* The service account a workload runs as won't change during the lifetime of the workload.

* Service account uniqueness can be ensured with domain name constraint

### Communication security

Service-to-service communication is tunneled through the client side [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.github.io/envoy/) and the server side Envoy. End-to-end communication is secured by:

* Local TCP connections between the service and Envoy

* Mutual TLS connections between proxies

* Secure Naming: during the handshake process, the client side Envoy checks that the service account provided by the server side certificate is allowed to run the target service

### Key management

Istio supports services running on both Kubernetes pods and VM/bare-metal machines. We use different key provisioning mechanisms for each scenario.

For services running on Kubernetes pods, the per-cluster Citadel (acting as Certificate Authority) automates the key & certificate management process. It mainly performs four critical operations:

* Generate a [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.github.io/docs/svid) key and certificate pair for each service account

* Distribute a key and certificate pair to each pod according to the service account

* Rotate keys and certificates periodically

* Revoke a specific key and certificate pair when necessary

For services running on VM/bare-metal machines, the above four operations are performed by Citadel together with node agents.

### Workflow

The Istio security workflow consists of two phases, deployment and runtime. For the deployment phase, we discuss the two
scenarios (i.e., in Kubernetes and VM/bare-metal machines) separately since they are different. Once the key and
certificate are deployed, the runtime phase is the same for the two scenarios. We briefly cover the workflow in this
section.

#### Deployment phase (Kubernetes Scenario)

1. Citadel watches the Kubernetes API Server, creates a [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.github.io/docs/svid) key and certificate
pair for each of the existing and new service accounts, and sends them to the API Server.

1. When a pod is created, API Server mounts the key and certificate pair according to the service account using [Kubernetes secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

1. [Pilot](/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#pilot-and-envoy) generates the config with proper key and certificate and secure naming information,
which defines what service account(s) can run a certain service, and passes it to Envoy.

#### Deployment phase (VM/bare-metal Machines Scenario)

1. Citadel creates a gRPC service to take CSR request.

1. Node agent creates the private key and CSR, sends the CSR to Citadel for signing.

1. Citadel validates the credentials carried in the CSR, and signs the CSR to generate the certificate.

1. Node agent puts the certificate received from Citadel and the private key to Envoy.

1. The above CSR process repeats periodically for rotation.

#### Runtime phase

1. The outbound traffic from a client service is rerouted to its local Envoy.

1. The client side Envoy starts a mutual TLS handshake with the server side Envoy. During the handshake, it also does a secure naming check to verify that the service account presented in the server certificate can run the server service.

1. The traffic is forwarded to the server side Envoy after a mutual TLS connection is established, which is then forwarded to the server service through local TCP connections.

### Best practices

In this section, we provide a few deployment guidelines and then discuss a real-world scenario.

#### Deployment guidelines

* If there are multiple service operators (a.k.a. [SREs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering)) deploying different services in a cluster (typically in a medium- or large-size cluster), we recommend creating a separate [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces-walkthrough/) for each SRE team to isolate their access. For example, you could create a "team1-ns" namespace for team1, and "team2-ns" namespace for team2, such that both teams won't be able to access each other's services.

* If Citadel is compromised, all its managed keys and certificates in the cluster may be exposed. We *strongly* recommend running Citadel
on a dedicated namespace (for example, istio-citadel-ns), which only cluster admins have access to.

#### Example

Let's consider a 3-tier application with three services: photo-frontend, photo-backend, and datastore. Photo-frontend and photo-backend services are managed by the photo SRE team while the datastore service is managed by the datastore SRE team. Photo-frontend can access photo-backend, and photo-backend can access datastore. However, photo-frontend cannot access datastore.

In this scenario, a cluster admin creates 3 namespaces: istio-citadel-ns, photo-ns, and datastore-ns. Admin has access to all namespaces, and each team only has
access to its own namespace. The photo SRE team creates 2 service accounts to run photo-frontend and photo-backend respectively in namespace photo-ns. The
datastore SRE team creates 1 service account to run the datastore service in namespace datastore-ns. Moreover, we need to enforce the service access control
in [Istio Mixer](/docs/concepts/policies-and-telemetry/) such that photo-frontend cannot access datastore.

In this setup, Citadel is able to provide keys and certificates management for all namespaces, and isolate
microservice deployments from each other.

## Authentication Policy

Istio authentication policy enables operators to specify authentication requirements for a service (or services). Istio authentication policy is composed of two parts:

* Peer: verifies the party, the direct client, that makes the connection. The common authentication mechanism for this is [mutual TLS](/docs/concepts/security/#mutual-tls-authentication).

* Origin: verifies the party, the original client, that makes the request (e.g end-users, devices etc). JWT is the only supported mechanism for origin authentication at the moment.

Istio configures the server side to perform authentication, however, it does not enforce the policy on the client side. For mutual TLS authentication, users can use [destination rules](/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#destination-rules) to configure client side to follow the expected protocol. For other cases, the application is responsible to acquire and attach the credential (e.g JWT) to the request.

Identities from both authentication parts, if applicable, are output to the next layer (e.g authorization, Mixer). To simplify the authorization rules, the policy can also specify which identity (peer or origin) should be used as 'the principal'. By default, it is set to the peer's identity.

Authentication policies are saved in Istio config store (in 0.7, the storage implementation uses Kubernetes CRD), and distributed by control plane. Depending on the size of the mesh, config propagation may take a few seconds to a few minutes. During the transition, you can expect traffic lost or inconsistent authentication results.

{{< image width="80%" ratio="75%"
    link="./authn.svg"
    caption="Authentication Policy Architecture"
    >}}

Policy is scoped to namespaces, with (optional) target selector rules to narrow down the set of services (within the same namespace as the policy) on which the policy should be applied. This aligns with the ACL model based on Kubernetes RBAC. More specifically, only the admin of the namespace can set policies for services in that namespace.

Authentication is implemented by the Istio sidecars. For example, with an Envoy sidecar, it is a combination of SSL setting and HTTP filters. If authentication
fails, requests will be rejected (either with SSL handshake error code, or http 401, depending on the type of authentication mechanism). If authentication succeeds,
the following authenticated attributes will be generated:

* `source.principal`: peer principal. If peer authentication is not used, the attribute is not set.
* `request.auth.principal`: depends on the policy principal binding, this could be peer principal (if `USE_PEER`) or origin principal (if `USE_ORIGIN`).
* `request.auth.audiences`: reflect the audience (`aud`) claim within the origin JWT (JWT that is used for origin authentication)
* `request.auth.presenter`: similarly, reflect the authorized presenter (`azp`) claim of the origin JWT.
* `request.auth.claims`: all raw string claims from origin-JWT.

Origin principal (principal from origin authentication) is not explicitly output. In general, it can always be reconstructed by joining (`iss`)
and subject (`sub`) claims with a "/" separator (for example, if `iss` and `sub` claims are "*googleapis.com*" and "*123456*" respectively, then
the origin principal is "*googleapis.com/123456*"). On the other hand, if principal binding is `USE_ORIGIN`, `request.auth.principal` carries the
same value as origin principal.

### Anatomy of a policy

#### Target selectors

Defines rules to find service(s) on which policy should be applied. If no rule is provided, the policy is matched to all services in the same namespace of the policy, so-called namespace-level policy (as opposed to service-level policies which have non-empty selector rules). Istio uses the service-level policy if available, otherwise it falls back to namespace-level policy. If neither is defined, it uses the default policy based on service mesh config and/or service annotation, which can only set mutual TLS setting (these are mechanisms before Istio 0.7 to configure mutual TLS for Istio service mesh). See [testing Istio mutual TLS](/docs/tasks/security/mutual-tls/).

> Starting with 0.8, authentication policy is the recommended way to enable/disable mutual TLS per service. The option to use service annotation will be removed in a future release.

Operators are responsible for avoiding conflicts, e.g create more than one service-level policy that matches to the same service(s) (or more than one namespace-level policy on the same namespace).

Example: rule to select product-page service (on any port), and reviews:9000.

{{< text yaml >}}
targets:
- name: product-page
- name: reviews
  ports:
  - number: 9000
{{< /text >}}

#### Peer authentication

Defines authentication methods (and associated parameters) that are supported for peer authentication. It can list more than one method; only one of them needs to be satisfied for the authentication to pass. However, starting with the 0.7 release, only mutual TLS is supported. Omit this if peer authentication is not needed.

Example of peer authentication using mutual TLS:

{{< text yaml >}}
peers:
- mtls:
{{< /text >}}

> Starting with Istio 0.7, the `mtls` settings doesn't require any parameters (hence `-mtls: {}`, `- mtls:` or `- mtls: null` declaration is sufficient). In future, it may carry arguments to provide different mutual TLS implementations.

#### Origin authentication

Defines authentication methods (and associated parameters) that are supported for origin authentication. Only JWT is supported for this, however, the policy can list multiple JWTs by different issuers. Similar to peer authentication, only one of the listed methods needs to be satisfied for the authentication to pass.

{{< text yaml >}}
origins:
- jwt:
    issuer: "https://accounts.google.com"
    jwksUri: "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs"
{{< /text >}}

### Principal binding

Defines what is the principal from the authentication. By default, this will be the peer's principal (and if peer authentication is not applied, it will be left unset). Policy writers can choose to overwrite it with USE_ORIGIN. In future, we will also support *conditional-binding* (e.g USE_PEER when peer is X, otherwise USE_ORIGIN)

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Istio Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides namespace-level, service-level, method-level access control for services in the Istio Mesh.
It features:

* Role-Based semantics, which is simple and easy to use.

* Service-to-service and endUser-to-Service authorization.

* Flexibility through custom properties support in roles and role-bindings.

The diagram below shows the Istio RBAC architecture. Operators specify Istio RBAC policies. The policies are saved in
the Istio config store.

{{< image width="80%" ratio="56.25%"
    link="./IstioRBAC.svg"
    alt="Istio RBAC"
    caption="Istio RBAC Architecture"
    >}}

The Istio RBAC engine does two things:
* **Fetch RBAC policy.** Istio RBAC engine watches for changes on RBAC policy. It fetches the updated RBAC policy if it sees any changes.
* **Authorize Requests.** At runtime, when a request comes, the request context is passed to Istio RBAC engine. RBAC engine evaluates the
request context against the RBAC policies, and returns the authorization result (ALLOW or DENY).

### Request context

In the current release, the Istio RBAC engine is implemented as a [Mixer adapter](/docs/concepts/policies-and-telemetry/#adapters).
The request context is provided as an instance of the
[authorization template](/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/templates/authorization/). The request context
 contains all the information about the request and the environment that an authorization module needs to know. In particular, it has two parts:

* **subject** contains a list of properties that identify the caller identity, including `"user"` name/ID, `"groups"` the subject belongs to,
or any additional properties about the subject such as namespace, service name.
* **action** specifies "how a service is accessed". It includes `"namespace"`, `"service"`, `"path"`, `"method"` that the action is being taken on,
and any additional properties about the action.

Below we show an example "requestcontext".

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: authorization
metadata:
  name: requestcontext
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  subject:
    user: source.user | ""
    groups: ""
    properties:
      service: source.service | ""
      namespace: source.namespace | ""
  action:
    namespace: destination.namespace | ""
    service: destination.service | ""
    method: request.method | ""
    path: request.path | ""
    properties:
      version: request.headers["version"] | ""
{{< /text >}}

### Istio RBAC policy

Istio RBAC introduces `ServiceRole` and `ServiceRoleBinding`:

* **`ServiceRole`** defines a role for access to services in the mesh.
* **`ServiceRoleBinding`** grants a role to subjects (e.g., a user, a group, a service).

#### `ServiceRole`

A `ServiceRole` specification includes a list of rules. Each rule has the following standard fields:
* **services**: A list of service names, which are matched against the `action.service` field of the "requestcontext".
* **methods**: A list of method names which are matched against the `action.method` field of the "requestcontext". In the above "requestcontext",
this is the HTTP or gRPC method. Note that gRPC methods are formatted in the form of "packageName.serviceName/methodName" (case sensitive).
* **paths**: A list of HTTP paths which are matched against the `action.path` field of the "requestcontext". It is ignored in gRPC case.

A `ServiceRole` specification only applies to the **namespace** specified in `"metadata"` section. The "services" and "methods" are required
fields in a rule. "paths" is optional. If not specified or set to "*", it applies to "any" instance.

Here is an example of a simple role "service-admin", which has full access to all services in "default" namespace.

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: ServiceRole
metadata:
  name: service-admin
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - services: ["*"]
    methods: ["*"]
{{< /text >}}

Here is another role "products-viewer", which has read ("GET" and "HEAD") access to service "products.default.svc.cluster.local"
in "default" namespace.

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: ServiceRole
metadata:
  name: products-viewer
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - services: ["products.default.svc.cluster.local"]
    methods: ["GET", "HEAD"]
{{< /text >}}

In addition, we support **prefix matching** and **suffix matching** for all the fields in a rule. For example, you can define a "tester" role that
has the following permissions in "default" namespace:
* Full access to all services with prefix "test-" (e.g, "test-bookstore", "test-performance", "test-api.default.svc.cluster.local").
* Read ("GET") access to all paths with "/reviews" suffix (e.g, "/books/reviews", "/events/booksale/reviews", "/reviews")
in service "bookstore.default.svc.cluster.local".

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: ServiceRole
metadata:
  name: tester
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - services: ["test-*"]
    methods: ["*"]
  - services: ["bookstore.default.svc.cluster.local"]
    paths: ["*/reviews"]
    methods: ["GET"]
{{< /text >}}

In `ServiceRole`, the combination of "namespace"+"services"+"paths"+"methods" defines "how a service (services) is allowed to be accessed".
In some situations, you may need to specify additional constraints that a rule applies to. For example, a rule may only applies to a
certain "version" of a service, or only applies to services that are labeled "foo". You can easily specify these constraints using
custom fields.

For example, the following `ServiceRole` definition extends the previous "products-viewer" role by adding a constraint on service "version"
being "v1" or "v2". Note that the "version" property is provided by `"action.properties.version"` in "requestcontext".

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: ServiceRole
metadata:
  name: products-viewer-version
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - services: ["products.default.svc.cluster.local"]
    methods: ["GET", "HEAD"]
    constraints:
    - key: "version"
      values: ["v1", "v2"]
{{< /text >}}

#### `ServiceRoleBinding`

A `ServiceRoleBinding` specification includes two parts:
* **roleRef** refers to a `ServiceRole` resource **in the same namespace**.
* A list of **subjects** that are assigned the role.

A subject can either be a "user", or a "group", or is represented with a set of "properties". Each entry ("user" or "group" or an entry
in "properties") must match one of fields ("user" or "groups" or an entry in "properties") in the "subject" part of the "requestcontext"
instance.

Here is an example of `ServiceRoleBinding` resource "test-binding-products", which binds two subjects to the "product-viewer" `ServiceRole`:
* user "alice@yahoo.com".
* "reviews.abc.svc.cluster.local" service in "abc" namespace.

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: ServiceRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: test-binding-products
  namespace: default
spec:
  subjects:
  - user: "alice@yahoo.com"
  - properties:
      service: "reviews.abc.svc.cluster.local"
      namespace: "abc"
  roleRef:
    kind: ServiceRole
    name: "products-viewer"
{{< /text >}}

In the case that you want to make a service(s) publicly accessible, you can use set the subject to `user: "*"`. This will assign a `ServiceRole`
to all users/services.

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: ServiceRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: binding-products-allusers
  namespace: default
spec:
  subjects:
  - user: "*"
  roleRef:
    kind: ServiceRole
    name: "products-viewer"
{{< /text >}}

### Enabling RBAC

Istio RBAC can be enabled by adding the following Mixer adapter rule. The rule has two parts. The first part defines a RBAC handler.
It has two parameters, `"config_store_url"` and `"cache_duration"`.
* The `"config_store_url"` parameter specifies where RBAC engine fetches RBAC policies. The default value for `"config_store_url"` is
`"k8s://"`, which means Kubernetes API server. Alternatively, if you are testing RBAC policy locally, you may set it to a local directory
such as `"fs:///tmp/testdata/configroot"`.
* The `"cache_duration"` parameter specifies the duration for which the authorization results may be cached on Mixer client (i.e., Istio proxy).
The default value for `"cache_duration"` is 1 minute.

The second part defines a rule, which specifies that the RBAC handler should be invoked with the "requestcontext" instance [defined
earlier in the document](#request-context).

In the following example, Istio RBAC is enabled for "default" namespace. And the cache duration is set to 30 seconds.

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: rbac
metadata:
  name: handler
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  config_store_url: "k8s://"
  cache_duration: "30s"
---
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: rule
metadata:
  name: rbaccheck
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  match: destination.namespace == "default"
  actions:
  # handler and instance names default to the rule's namespace.
  - handler: handler.rbac
    instances:
    - requestcontext.authorization
