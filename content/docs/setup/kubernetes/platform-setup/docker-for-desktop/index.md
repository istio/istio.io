If you want to run istio under docker for desktop's built-in Kubernetes, you may need to increase docker's memory limit
under the *Advanced* pane of docker's preferences.  Pilot by default requests `2048Mi` of memory, which is docker's
default limit.

Alternatively, you may reduce Pilot's memory reservation by passing the helm argument
`--set pilot.resources.requests.memory="512Mi"`.  Otherwise Pilot may refuse to start due to insufficient resources.
See [Installation Options](/docs/reference/config/installation-options) for more information.
