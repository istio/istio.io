This guide demonstrates how to upgrade the Istio control plane and data plane
for the Kubernetes environment.

## Overview

This guide describes how to upgrade an existing Istio deployment (including both control plane and sidecar proxy) to a new release of Istio. The upgrade process could involve new binaries as well as other changes like configuration and API schemas. The upgrade process may involve some service downtime. To minimize the service downtime, please ensure your istio control plane components and your application are highly available with multiple replicas.

## Application setup

In the following steps, we assume that the Istio components are installed and upgraded in the the `istio-system` namespace.

## Tasks

### Control plane upgrade

The Istio control plane components include: Citadel, Ingress gateway, Egress gateway, Pilot, Policy, Telemetry and
Sidecar injector. We can use Kubernetesâ€™ rolling update mechanism to upgrade the
control plane components.

First, generate the desired istio control plane yaml file, e.g.

```command
helm template --namespace istio-system --set global.proxy.image=proxy \
  --values install/kubernetes/helm/istio/values-istio.yaml \
  install/kubernetes/helm/istio >> install/kubernetes/istio.yaml
```

or

```command
helm template --namespace istio-system --set global.proxy.image=proxy \
  --values install/kubernetes/helm/istio/values-istio-auth.yaml \
  install/kubernetes/helm/istio >> install/kubernetes/istio-auth.yaml
```

If using Kubernetes earlier than 1.9, you should add ```--set sidecarInjectorWebhook.enabled=false```.

Second, simply apply the new version of the desired istio control plane yaml file directly, e.g.

```command
$ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio.yaml
```

or

```command
$ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-auth.yaml
```

The rolling update process will upgrade all deployments and configmaps to the new version. After this process finishes, your Istio control plane should be updated to the new version. Your existing application should continue to work without any change, using the Envoy v1 proxy and the v1alpha1 route rules. If there is any critical issue with the new control plane, you can rollback the changes by applying the yaml files from the old version.

### Sidecar upgrade

The applications already running istio will still using the sidecar from 0.7.1 and will continue to work. After the control plane is upgraded, you will need to re-inject so they run with the new version of sidecar proxy. There are two cases: Manual injection and Automatic injection.

1.  Manual injection:

    If automatic sidecar injection is not enabled, you can upgrade the
    sidecar manually by running the following command:

    ```command
    $ kubectl replace -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f $ORIGINAL_DEPLOYMENT_YAML)
    ```

    If the sidecar was previously injected with some customized inject config
    files, you will need to change the version tag in the config files to the new
    version and reinject the sidecar as follows:

    ```command
    $ kubectl replace -f <(istioctl kube-inject \
         --injectConfigFile inject-config.yaml \
         --filename $ORIGINAL_DEPLOYMENT_YAML)
    ```

1.  Automatic injection:

    If automatic sidecar injection is enabled, you can upgrade the sidecar
    by doing a rolling update for all the pods, so that the new version of
    sidecar will be automatically re-injected

    There are some tricks to reload all pods. E.g. There is a [bash script](https://gist.github.com/jmound/ff6fa539385d1a057c82fa9fa739492e)
    which triggers the rolling update by patching the grace termination period.

### Migrating to the new networking APIs

Once you upgrade the control plane, you can gradually move pods to use the new API version by adding:

```yaml

kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  template:
    annotations:
       sidecar.istio.io/proxyImage: istio/proxyv2:0.8.latest

```

When all your applications have been migrated and tested, you can repeat the istio upgrade process, removing the `--set global.proxy.image=proxy` option.

### Migrating per-service mutual TLS enablement via annotations to authentication policy

If you use service annotations to override global mutual TLS enablement for a service, you need to replace it with [authentication policy](/docs/concepts/security/authn-policy/) and [destination rules](/docs/concepts/traffic-management/rules-configuration/#destination-rules).

For example, if you install Istio with mutual TLS enabled, and disable it for service `foo` using a service annotation like below:

```yaml
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: foo
  namespace: bar
  annotations:
    auth.istio.io/8000: NONE
```

You need to replace this with this authentication policy and destination rule (deleting the old annotation is optional)

```yaml
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "disable-mTLS-foo"
  namespace: bar
spec:
  targets:
  - name: foo
    ports:
    - number: 8000
  peers:
---
apiVersion: "networking.istio.io/v1alpha3"
kind: "DestinationRule"
metadata:
  name: "disable-mTLS-foo"
  namespace: "bar"
spec:
  host: "foo"
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
    portLevelSettings:
    - port:
        number: 8000
      tls:
        mode: DISABLE
```

If you already have destination rules for `foo`, you must edit that rule instead of creating a new one.
When create a new destination rule, make sure to include other settings, i.e `load balancer`, `connection pool` and `outlier detection` if necessary.
Finally, If `foo` doesn't have sidecar, you can skip authentication policy, but still need to add destination rule.

If 8000 is the only port that service `foo` provides (or you want to disable mutual TLS for all ports), the policies can be simplified as:

```yaml
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "disable-mTLS-foo"
    namespace: bar
  spec:
    targets:
    - name: foo
    peers:
---
apiVersion: "networking.istio.io/v1alpha3"
kind: "DestinationRule"
metadata:
  name: "disable-mTLS-foo"
  namespace: "bar"
spec:
  host: "foo"
trafficPolicy:
  tls:
    mode: DISABLE
```

### Migrating `mtls_excluded_services` config to destination rules

If you installed Istio with mutual TLS enabled, and used mesh config `mtls_excluded_services` to disable mutual TLS when connecting to these services (e.g kubernetes API server), you need to replace this by adding a destination rule. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: "kubernetes-master"
  namespace: "default"
spec:
  host: "kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local"
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: DISABLE
```
