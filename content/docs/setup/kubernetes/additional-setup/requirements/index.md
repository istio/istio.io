To be a part of the service mesh, pods and services in a Kubernetes
cluster must satisfy the following requirements:

* _**Named service ports**:_ Service ports must be named. The port names must be of
  the form `<protocol>[-<suffix>]` with `grpc`, `http`, `http2`, `https`, `mongo`, `redis`, `tcp`, `tls` or `udp`
  as the `<protocol>` in order to take advantage of Istio's routing features.
  For example, `name: http2-foo` or `name: http` are valid port names, but
  `name: http2foo` is not.  If the port name does not begin with a recognized
  prefix or if the port is unnamed, traffic on the port will be treated as
  plain TCP traffic (unless the port [explicitly](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service)
  uses `Protocol: UDP` to signify a UDP port).

* _**Pod ports**:_ Pods must include an explicit list of ports each container will listen on.
  Use a `containerPort` in the container spec for each port.  Any unlisted ports will bypass the Istio
  Proxy.

* _**Service association**:_ A pod must belong to at least one [Kubernetes service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/),
  even if it does NOT expose any port.
  If a pod belongs to multiple [Kubernetes services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/),
  the services cannot use the same port number for different protocols, for instance HTTP and TCP.

* _**Deployments with app and version labels**:_ It is recommended that pods deployed using
  the Kubernetes `Deployment` have an explicit `app` label and `version` label in the
  deployment specification. Each deployment specification should have a
  distinct `app` label with a value indicating something meaningful, with `version`
  indicating the version of the app that the particular deployment corresponds to. The
  `app` label is used to add contextual information in distributed
  tracing. The `app` and `version` labels are also used to add contextual information
  in the metric telemetry collected by Istio.

* _**Application UIDs**_: Do **not** run applications as a user with the user ID (UID) value of **1337**.

* _**`NET_ADMIN` capability**:_ If pod security policies are enforced in your cluster and unless you use the [Istio CNI Plugin](/docs/setup/kubernetes/install/cni/), your pods must have the `NET_ADMIN` capability allowed.
See [Required Pod Capabilities](/help/ops/setup/required-pod-capabilities/).
