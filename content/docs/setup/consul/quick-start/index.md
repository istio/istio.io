Quick Start instructions to install and configure Istio in a Docker Compose setup.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#cloud)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Installation steps

1.  Go to the [Istio release](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases) page to download the
    installation file corresponding to your OS. If you are using a MacOS or Linux system, you can also
    run the following command to download and extract the latest release automatically:

    ```command
    $ curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -
    ```

1.  Extract the installation file and change the directory to the file location. The
installation directory contains:

    * Sample applications in `samples/`
    * The `istioctl` client binary in the `bin/` directory. `istioctl` is used for creating routing rules and policies.
    * The `istio.VERSION` configuration file

1.  Add the `istioctl` client to your PATH.
For example, run the following command on a MacOS or Linux system:

    ```command
    $ export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
    ```

1.  For Linux users, configure the `DOCKER_GATEWAY` environment variable

    ```command
    $ export DOCKER_GATEWAY=172.28.0.1:
    ```

1. Change directory to the root of the Istio installation directory.

1.  Bring up the Istio control plane containers:

    ```command
    $ docker-compose -f @install/consul/istio.yaml@ up -d
    ```

1.  Confirm that all docker containers are running:

    ```command
    $ docker ps -a
    ```

    > If the Istio Pilot container terminates, ensure that you run the `istioctl context-create` command and re-run the command from the previous step.

1.  Configure `istioctl` to use mapped local port for the Istio API server:

    ```command
    $ istioctl context-create --api-server http://localhost:8080
    ```

## Deploy your application

You can now deploy your own application or one of the sample applications provided with the
installation like [Bookinfo](/docs/guides/bookinfo/).

> Since there is no concept of pods in a Docker setup, the Istio
> sidecar runs in the same container as the application.  We will
> use [Registrator](https://gliderlabs.github.io/registrator/latest/) to
> automatically register instances of services in the Consul service
> registry.
>
> The application must use HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.0 protocol for all its HTTP traffic because HTTP/1.0 is not supported.

```command
$ docker-compose -f <your-app-spec>.yaml up -d
```

## Uninstalling

Uninstall Istio core components by removing the docker containers:

```command
$ docker-compose -f @install/consul/istio.yaml@ down
```

## What's next

* See the sample [Bookinfo](/docs/guides/bookinfo/) application.
