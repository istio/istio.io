From here you can learn all about Istio's architecture and how to deploy and use Istio.

- [Concepts](/docs/concepts/). Concepts explain some significant aspect of Istio. This
is where you can learn about what Istio does and how it does it.

- [Setup](/docs/setup/). Setup contains instructions for installing
  the Istio control plane in various environments, as well as instructions
  for installing the sidecar in the application deployment. Quick start
  instructions are available for
  [Kubernetes](/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start/) and
  [Docker Compose w/ Consul](/docs/setup/consul/quick-start/).

- [Tasks](/docs/tasks/). Tasks show you how to do a single directed activity with Istio.

- [Guides](/docs/guides/). Guides are fully working stand-alone examples
intended to highlight a particular set of Istio's features.

- [Reference](/docs/reference/). Detailed exhaustive lists of
command-line options, configuration options, API definitions, and procedures.
