title: Selective service exposure
---

In the context of multicluster service mesh deployments, selective service exposure means that the operators of a
cluster decide which services in their cluster they want to expose to workloads in other clusters. The operators
have the ability to limit the exposure only to the services they decided to expose. By default, no services are exposed
and the operators must configure explicitly the services selected for exposure.
