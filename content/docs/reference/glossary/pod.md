A Pod is a group of one or more containers (such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers), with shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers. A pod is the smallest deployable unit of computing in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/).
