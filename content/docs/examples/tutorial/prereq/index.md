For this tutorial you need a Kubernetes cluster with a namespace for the tutorial's modules and a
local computer to run the commands. If you are participating in a guided workshop
and the instructor provides the cluster, let them handle the Kubernetes cluster prerequisites, and you can skip ahead to
setup your local computer.

If you want to proceed using your own cluster, ensure your cluster satisfies the prerequisites for the cluster as well.

## Kubernetes cluster

Ensure the following conditions are met:

- You have administrator privileges on a Kubernetes cluster.
- You can create a namespace in the cluster for each participant.

## Local computer

Ensure the following conditions are met:

- You have write access to the local computer's `/etc/hosts` file.
- You have the ability and permission to download, install and run command line tools on the local computer.
- You have Internet connectivity for the duration of the tutorial.
