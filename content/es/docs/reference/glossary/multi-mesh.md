Multi-mesh is a deployment model that consists of two or more [service meshes](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh).
Each mesh has independent administration for naming and identities but you can
expose services between meshes through [mesh federation](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#mesh-federation).
The resulting deployment is a multi-mesh deployment.
