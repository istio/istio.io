The data plane mode refers to which deployment mode the [data plane](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#data-plane) is using.
Istio currently supports three modes: [sidecar mode](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#sidecar), [ambient mode](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#ambient), and [proxyless](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#proxyless).
