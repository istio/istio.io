A primary cluster is a [cluster](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#cluster) with a
[control plane](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#control-plane). A single
[mesh](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh) can have more than
one primary cluster for HA or to reduce latency. Primary clusters can act as the
control plane for [remote clusters](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#remote-cluster).
