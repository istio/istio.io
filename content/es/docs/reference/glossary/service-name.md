test: n/a

A name that uniquely identifies a [service](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#service) within the [service mesh](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh).
A service may not be renamed while maintaining its identity.
A service may have multiple [versions](/es/docs/reference/glossary/#service-version), but a service name is version-independent.
