Envoy, and subsequently Istio are vulnerable to two newly discovered vulnerabilities:

* __[CVE-2019-18801](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18801)__: This vulnerability affects Envoyâ€™s HTTP/1 codec in its way it processes downstream's requests with large HTTP/2 headers. A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of Service, escalation of privileges, or information disclosure.

* __[CVE-2019-18802](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18802)__: HTTP/1 codec incorrectly fails to trim whitespace after header values. This could allow an attacker to bypass Istio's policy either for information disclosure or escalation of privileges.

* __[CVE-2019-18838](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18838)__: Upon receipt of a malformed HTTP request without the "Host" header, an encoder filter invoking Envoy's route manager APIs that access request's "Host" header will cause a NULL pointer to be dereferenced and result in abnormal termination of the Envoy process.

## Impact and detection

Both Istio gateways and sidecars are vulnerable to this issue. If you are running one of the affected releases where downstream's requests are HTTP/2 while upstream's are HTTP/1, then your cluster is vulnerable.  We expect this to be true of most clusters.

## Mitigation

* For Istio 1.2.x deployments: update to [Istio 1.2.10](/news/releases/1.2.x/announcing-1.2.10) or later.
* For Istio 1.3.x deployments: update to [Istio 1.3.6](/news/releases/1.3.x/announcing-1.3.6) or later.
* For Istio 1.4.x deployments: update to [Istio 1.4.2](/news/releases/1.4.x/announcing-1.4.2) or later.
