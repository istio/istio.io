Ensure that your cluster has met the
[prerequisites](/docs/setup/kubernetes/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection) for
the automatic sidecar injection. If your microservice is deployed in
`kube-system`, `kube-public` or `istio-system` namespaces, they are exempted
from automatic sidecar injection. Please use a different namespace
instead.
