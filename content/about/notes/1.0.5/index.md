## Fixes

- Disabled the precondition cache in the istio-policy service as it lead to invalid results. The
cache will be reintroduced in a later release.

- Mixer now only generates spans when there is an enabled `tracespan` adapter, resulting in lower CPU overhead in normal cases.

- Fixed a problem that could lead Pilot to hang.
