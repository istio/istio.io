We're proud to release Istio 1.0! Istio has been in development for nearly two years, and the 1.0 release represents a substantial
milestone for us. All of our [core features](/about/feature-stages/) are now ready for production use.

These release notes describe what's different between Istio 0.8 and Istio 1.0. Istio 1.0 only has a few new features
relative to 0.8 as most of the effort for this release went into fixing bugs and improving performance.
