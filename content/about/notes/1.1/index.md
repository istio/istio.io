We're proud to release Istio 1.1!

We've spent the last 8 months making some significant improvements to the
overall product, with fixes and features from Google, IBM, VMware, Huawei,
RedHat, Cisco, SAP, Salesforce, Pivotal, SUSE, Datadog and LightStep, to name a
few. Special thanks to all of our end-users for providing feedback, feature
requests, and testing the release candidates at various scales.

These release notes describe what's different between Istio 1.0.6 and Istio 1.1.
