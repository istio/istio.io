This page shows how to stage content that you want to contribute
to the Istio documentation.

## Before you begin

Create a fork of the Istio documentation repository as described in
[Creating a Doc Pull Request](/about/contribute/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Staging locally

See [Detailed instructions and options on GitHub](https://github.com/istio/istio.github.io/blob/master/README.md)

Once Hugo is running, you can open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:1313` to see your
changes. You can make further changes to the content in your repo and just refresh your browser page to see
the results, no need to restart Hugo all the time.

## Staging from your GitHub account

Once you push a PR from your fork to the istio.github.io's master branch, your PR page on GitHub will show a link to a staging site
built automatically for your PR. This is useful for folks trying to review your changes.
