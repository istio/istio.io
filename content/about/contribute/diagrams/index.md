Welcome to the Istio diagram guide!

The guide is available as an [SVG file](./diagram-guidelines.svg) or as a
[Google Draw file](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1f3NyutAQIDOA8ojGNyMA5JAJllDShZGQAFfdD01XdSc/edit)
to allow you to reuse the shapes and styles with ease. Use these guidelines to
create SVG diagrams for the Istio website using any vector graphics tool like
Google Draw, InkScape, or Illustrator. Please ensure that the text in your
diagrams remains editable.

Our goal is to drive consistency across all diagrams in our website to ensure
diagrams are clear, technically accurate, and accessible.

Keeping the text editable allows the community to improve and change the
diagrams as needed.

Follow these steps to begin using the guideline:

1. [Download the guidelines as an SVG file.](./diagram-guidelines.svg)
1. Select the shapes you want to use.
1. Copy them into a new SVG file.
1. Make as many duplicates as you need for your diagram.
1. Connect the shapes with the appropriate style of line.
1. Label the shapes and lines with descriptive yet short text.
1. Add a legend for any labels that apply multiple times.

If your diagram depicts a process, **do not add the descriptions of the steps**
to the diagram. Instead, only add the numbers of the steps to the diagram and
add the descriptions of the steps as a numbered list in the document. Ensure
that the numbers on the list match the numbers on your diagram. This approach
helps make diagrams easier to understand and the content more accessible.

Thank you for contributing to the Istio documentation!
