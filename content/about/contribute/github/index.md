We're excited that you're interested in contributing to improve and expand
our docs! Please take a few moments to get familiar with our procedures before
you get started.

To work on Istio documentation, you need to:

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com).

1. Sign the [Contributor License
   Agreement](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreements).

The documentation is published under the [Apache
2.0](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

## How to contribute

There are two ways you can contribute to the Istio documentation:

* If you want to edit an existing page, you can open up the page in your
  browser and select the **Edit This Page on GitHub** option from the gear menu
  at the top right of each page. This takes you to GitHub to edit and
  submit the changes.

* If you want to work on the site in general, you must create a fork of the
  repository. Click the button below to visit the GitHub repository. Then, you
  must click the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner of the screen to
  create a copy of our repository in your GitHub account. Create a clone of
  your fork and make any changes you want. When you are ready to send those
  changes to us, push the changes to your fork, go to the index page for your
  fork, and click **New Pull Request** to let us know about it.

<a class="btn btn-istio"
href="https://github.com/istio/istio.io/">Browse this site's source
code</a>

Once your changes are merged, they show up immediately on
`preliminary.istio.io`. However, the changes only
show up on `istio.io` the next time we produce a new
release, which happens around once a quarter.

## Previewing your work

When you submit a pull request, your PR page on GitHub shows a link to a
staging site built automatically for your PR. This is useful for you to see
what the final page looks like to end-users. Folks reviewing your
pull request also use this staging site to make sure everything looks good.

If you created a fork of the repository, you can preview your changes locally.
See this
[README](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/blob/master/README.md) for
instructions.
