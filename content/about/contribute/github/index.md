We're excited that you're interested in contributing to improving and expanding our docs!
Please take a few moments to get familiar with our procedures before you get started.

To work on Istio documentation, you need to:

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com).

1. Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreements).

Documentation will be published under the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/istio/istio.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

## How to contribute

There are two ways you can contribute to the Istio documentation:

1. If you want to edit an existing page, you can open up the page in your browser and select the "Edit This Page on GitHub" option from the
gear menu at the top right of each page. This will take you to GitHub to edit and submit the changes.

1. If you want to work on the site in general, you will need to create a fork of the repository.
Click the button below to visit the GitHub repository. You can then click the
**Fork** button in the upper-right area of the screen to
create a copy of our site in your GitHub account. Make any changes you want in your fork, and when you
are ready to send those changes to us, go to the index page for your fork and click **New Pull Request** to let us know about it.

<a class="btn btn-istio" href="https://github.com/istio/istio.github.io/">Browse this site's source code</a>

Once your changes have been committed, they will show up immediately on [preliminary.istio.io](https://preliminary.istio.io), but
will only show up on [istio.io](https://istio.io) the next time we produce a new release, which happens around once a month.

## Previewing your work

When you submit a pull request, your PR page on GitHub will show a link to a staging site
built automatically for your PR. This is useful for you to see what the final page will look
like to end-users. Folks that are reviewing your pull request also use this staging site to
make sure everything looks good.

If you created a fork of the repository, you can preview your changes locally. See this
[README](https://github.com/istio/istio.github.io/blob/master/README.md) for instructions.
