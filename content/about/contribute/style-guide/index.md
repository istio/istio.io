This page provides the content guidelines for the Istio documentation. These
guidelines do not supersede your best judgment and enhancements to this
document in a pull request are welcome.

## Formatting standards

### Use consistent capitalization

Don't use capitalization for emphasis.

Follow the original capitalization employed in the code or configuration files
when referencing those values directly. Use back-ticks \`\` around the
referenced content to make the connection explicit. For example, use
`IstioRoleBinding`, not `Istio Role Binding` or `istio role binding`.

If you are not referencing values or code directly, use normal sentence
capitalization, for example, "The Istio role binding configuration takes place
in a YAML file."

### Use angle brackets for placeholders

Use angle brackets for placeholders. Tell the reader what the placeholder
represents. For example:

1.  Display information about a pod:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    {{< /text >}}

    Where `<pod-name>` is the name of one of your pods.

### Use **bold** for user interface elements

|Do               |Don't
|-----------------|------
|Click **Fork**.  |Click "Fork".
|Select **Other**.|Select 'Other'.

### Use _italics_ to define or introduce new terms

|Do                                         |Don't
|-------------------------------------------|---
|A _cluster_ is a set of nodes ...          |A "cluster" is a set of nodes ...
|These components form the _control plane_. |These components form the **control plane**.

### Use `code` style for filenames, directories, and paths

|Do                                   | Don't
|-------------------------------------|------
|Open the `foo.yaml` file.         | Open the foo.yaml file.
|Go to the `/content/docs/tasks` directory.  | Go to the /content/docs/tasks directory.
|Open the `/data/args.yaml` file. | Open the /data/args.yaml file.

### Use `code` style for inline code and commands

|Do                          | Don't
|----------------------------|------
|The `foo run` command creates a `Deployment`.|The "foo run" command creates a `Deployment`.
|For declarative management, use `foo apply`.|For declarative management, use "foo apply".

### Use `code` style for object field names

|Do                                                               | Don't
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------
|Set the value of the `ports` field in the configuration file. | Set the value of the "ports" field in the configuration file.
|The value of the `rule` field is a `Rule` object.           | The value of the "rule" field is a `Rule` object.

## Use title capitalization for `title:` front-matter

The text for the `title:` front-matter must use title case:
Capitalize the first letter of every word except conjunctions and prepositions.
This is unlike headings within the document, as described below.

### Only capitalize the first letter of headings

For any headings use sentence case: only capitalize the first word of the
heading, except for proper nouns or acronyms. Note that the
`title:` annotation in markdown uses title case.

|Do                      | Don't
|------------------------|-----
|Configuring rate limits | Configuring Rate Limits
|Using Envoy for ingress | Using envoy for ingress
|Using HTTPS             | Using https

## Terminology standards

We want to use the standard terms in this section consistently within the
documentation for clarity.

### Envoy

We prefer to use "Envoy” as it’s a more concrete term than "proxy" and
resonates if used consistently throughout the docs.

Synonyms:

- "Envoy sidecar” - ok
- "Envoy proxy” - ok
- "The Istio proxy” -- best to avoid unless you’re talking about advanced scenarios where another proxy might be used.
- "Sidecar”  -- mostly restricted to conceptual docs
- "Proxy" -- only if context is obvious

Related Terms:

- Proxy agent  - This is a minor infrastructural component and should only show
  up in low-level detail documentation. It is not a proper noun.

### Miscellaneous

|Do              | Don't
|----------------|------
| load balancing | `load-balancing`
| multicluster   | `multi-cluster`
| addon          | `add-on`
| service mesh   | `Service Mesh`
| sidecar        | `side-car`, `Sidecar`
| Kubernetes     | `kubernetes`, `k8s`
| Bookinfo       | `BookInfo`, `bookinfo`
| Mixer          | `mixer`
| certificate    | `cert`
| configuration  | `config`
| delete         | `kill`

## Best practices

### Use present tense

|Do                           | Don't
|-----------------------------|------
|This command starts a proxy. | This command will start a proxy.

Exception: Use future or past tense if it is required to convey the correct
meaning. This exception is extremely rare and should be avoided.

### Use active voice

|Do                                         | Don't
|-------------------------------------------|------
|You can explore the API using a browser.   | The API can be explored using a browser.
|The YAML file specifies the replica count. | The replica count is specified in the YAML file.

### Use simple and direct language

Use simple and direct language. Avoid using unnecessary phrases, such as saying
"please."

|Do                          | Don't
|----------------------------|------
|To create a `ReplicaSet`, ... | In order to create a `ReplicaSet`, ...
|See the configuration file. | Please see the configuration file.
|View the Pods.              | With this next command, we'll view the Pods.

### Address the reader as "you"

|Do                                     | Don't
|---------------------------------------|------
|You can create a `Deployment` by ...     | We'll create a `Deployment` by ...
|In the preceding output, you can see...| In the preceding output, we can see ...

### Create useful links

There are good hyperlinks, and bad hyperlinks. The common practice of calling
links *here*  or *click here* are examples of bad hyperlinks. Check out [this
excellent article](https://medium.com/@heyoka/dont-use-click-here-f32f445d1021)
explaining what makes a good hyperlink and try to keep these guidelines in
mind when creating or reviewing site content.

### Avoid using "we"

Using "we" in a sentence can be confusing, because the reader might not know
whether they're part of the "we" you're describing.

|Do                                        | Don't
|------------------------------------------|------
|Version 1.4 includes ...                  | In version 1.4, we have added ...
|Istio provides a new feature for ... | We provide a new feature ...
|This page teaches you how to use pods.    | In this page, we are going to learn about pods.

### Avoid jargon and idioms

Some readers speak English as a second language. Avoid jargon and idioms to help make their understanding easier.

|Do                    | Don't
|----------------------|------
|Internally, ...       | Under the hood, ...
|Create a new cluster. | Turn up a new cluster.

### Avoid statements about the future

Avoid making promises or giving hints about the future. If you need to talk
about an alpha feature, put the text under a heading that identifies it as
alpha information.

### Avoid statements that will soon be out of date

Avoid words like "currently" and "new". A feature that is new today might not
be considered new in a few months.

|Do                                  | Don't
|------------------------------------|------
|In version 1.4, ...                 | In the current version, ...
|The Federation feature provides ... | The new Federation feature provides ...
