project or get involved by visiting the [community repository on GitHub](https://github.com/istio/community). There you can learn about
our project's [engineering values](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/VALUES.md),
our [working groups](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/WORKING-GROUPS.md) which take care of different product areas,
the [different roles](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/ROLES.md) within our development community,
