{{< warning >}}
Ambient mode is currently in the [Alpha](/docs/releases/feature-stages/#feature-phase-definitions) phase.

Please **do not use ambient mode in production**, and be sure to thoroughly review the [feature phase definitions](/docs/releases/feature-stages/#feature-phase-definitions) before use.

In particular, there are known performance, stability, and security issues in the alpha release.
There are also planned breaking changes, including some that will prevent upgrades.
These limitations will be addressed before ambient mode moves to Beta.
