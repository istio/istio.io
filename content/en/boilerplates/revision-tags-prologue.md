Now, the updated mapping between revisions, tags, and namespaces is as shown below:

Restarting injected workloads in the namespaces marked `prod-stable` will now result in those workloads using the `1-10-0`
control plane. Notice that no namespace relabeling was required to migrate workloads to the new revision.
