## Installation

- **Added** a command line [Istio operator](docs/setup/install/operator/) to install and manage the Istio control plane.

## Traffic Management

- **Added** automatic determination of protocol types. This removes the need for you to explicitly classify ports as `http` or `tcp`.
- **Added** a mode to the Gateway API for mutual TLS operation. The new mode can read certificates via SDS.
- **Added** Sidecar proxy readiness checks now check Envoy's readiness status.
- **Fixed** issues present when a service communicates over the network first in permissive mutual TLS mode for protocols like MySQL and MongoDB.
- **Improved** the `EnvoyFilter` API. You can now add or update all configurations.
- **Improved** the Redis load balancer to now default to `MAGLEV` when using the Redis proxy.
- **Improved** traffic management to direct traffic to the same region and zone.
- **Improved** Pilot performance. The reduction in CPU utilization could be up to 10 times depending on deployment.
- **Improved** service entries to allow for the same host name in different namespaces.
- **Improved** the Sidecar API to customize the `OutboundTrafficPolicy` policy.

## Security

- **Added** a unified logging pattern to Citadel agent.
- **Added** metrics into Citadel agent to monitor SDS push.
- **Added** the capability to ingress gateway to provide client CA certificates when using SDS.
- **Added** trust domain validation when you use mutual TLS with the `Sidecars` resource.
- **Added** the labels `ca.istio.io/env` and `ca.istio.io/override`  to allow operators to control service account secret generation by namespace.
- **Removed** integration with Vault CA temporarily. This was caused by SDS requirements and will be reintroduced in a new release.
- **Improved** the performance of secrets handling in the sidecars by introducing SDS.
- **Improved** security and reliability by enabling the the Envoy JWT filter by default.
- **Improved** the reliability of SDS by requiring Kubernetes 1.13. Please be aware that while Istio functions on Kubernetes 1.12, SDS [requires Kubernetes 1.13](/blog/2019/trustworthy-jwt-sds).

## Telemetry

- **Added** support for Envoy gRPC Access Log Service [ALS](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/service/accesslog/v2/als.proto#grpc-access-log-service-als).
- **Added** a Grafana dashboard for Citadel monitoring.
- **Added** [metrics](/reference/commands/sidecar-injector/#metrics) for monitoring the sidecar injector webhook.
- **Added** control plane metrics to monitor Istio configuration state.
- **Added** telemetry reporting for traffic destined to `Passthrough` and `BlackHole` cluster.
- **Added** alpha support for in-proxy generation of service metrics using Prometheus.
- **Added** alpha support for environmental metadata in Envoy node metadata.
- **Added** alpha support for Proxy Metadata Exchange.
- **Added** alpha support for OpenCensus trace driver.
- **Improved** the mesh dashboard to provide monitoring of Istio configuration state.
- **Improved** the Pilot dashboard to expose additional key metrics to more clearly identify errors.
- **Removed** deprecated Adapter and Template custom resource definitions.
- **Deprecated** Mixer adapters. Extensions are expected to begin transition to new extension model. Legacy Mixer integration support will be maintained for 1.3 and 1.4.
- **Deprecated** Deprecated HTTP API Spec. The support for producing API attributes will be be removed in Istio 1.4.

## Policy

- **Improved** rate limit enforcement to allow communication when the quota backend is unavailable.

## Configuration Management

- **Added** the ability to configure Galley to use newer configuration processing.
- **Fixed** an issue in Galley where too many gRPC pings close connections.
- **Improved** Galley to avoid control plane upgrade failures.

## istioctl

- **Added** `istioctl kube-uninject` to remove Istio configuration from a previously injected configuration.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental describe pod` to produce the Istio configuration affecting a Pod.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental manifest apply` to generate and apply an Istio installation.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental manifest diff` to show the difference betweeen two manifests.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental manifest generate` to generate an Istio installation manifest.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental manifest migrate` to convert Istio's `values.yaml` file into a format suitable for the Istio operator.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental manifest versions` to list all supported Istio versions.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental profile diff Show` to show the difference between two Istio profiles.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental profile dump` to show an Istio configuration profile.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental profile list` to list all Istio profiles.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental add-to-mesh` to add virtual machines into the Istio service mesh.
- **Added** `istioctl experimental remove-from-mesh` to remove virtual machines into the Istio service mesh.
- **Improved** Promoted the `istioctl` subcommands `metrics`, `convert-ingress`, and `dashboard` to supported features.

## Other

- **Added** New images based on distroless base images.
- **Improved** the Istio CNI Helm chart to have consistent versions with Istio.
- **Added** the ability for Kubernetes Jobs to exit correctly when finished.
