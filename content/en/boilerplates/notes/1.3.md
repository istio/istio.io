## Traffic Management

**Added** the capability for Istio to automatically determine protocol types avoiding the need for specifying the mandatory container ports field in the pod spec.
**Added** a mode to the Gateway API for mutual TLS operation that is capable of reading certificates via SDS.
**Added** enhancements to the `EnvoyFiltier` API such that all configuration can be added or updated.
**Fixed** Sidecar proxy readiness checks now check Envoy's readiness status.
**Fixed** issues with protocols like MySQL and MongoDB where the service communicates over the network first in permissive mutual TLS mode.
**Improved** Redis load balancer defaults to `MAGLEV` when using the Redis proxy.
**Improved** traffic management to direct traffic to the same region and zone.
**Improved** Pilot performance.  CPU utilization may be up to 10 times lower.
**Improved** the capabilities of `ServiceEntries` to enable the same hostname in different namespaces.
**Improved** the capability of the Sidecar API to customize `OutboundTrafficPolicy`.

## Security

**Added** a unified logging pattern to Citadel agent.
**Added** metrics into Citadel agent to monitor SDS push.
**Added** the capability to ingress gateway to provide client CA certificates when using SDS.
**Added** the capability for trust domain validation when sidecars use mutual TLS.
**Added** the labels `ca.istio.io/env` and `ca.istio.io/override`  to allow operators to control service account secret generation by namespace.
**Removed** integration with Vault CA temporarily. This was caused by SDS requirements and will be reintroduced in a new release.
**Improved** the performance of secrets handling in the sidecars by introducing SDS.
**Improved** security and reliability by enabling the the Envoy JWT filter by default.
**Improved** the reliability of SDS by requiring Kubernetes 1.13. Please be aware that while Istio supports Kubernetes 1.12, SDS [requires Kubernetes 1.13](/blog/2019/trustworthy-jwt-sds).
