## Traffic Management

**Added** the capability for Istio to automatically determine protocol types avoiding the need for specifying the mandatory container ports field in the pod spec.
**Added** a mode to the Gateway API for mutual TLS operation that is capable of reading certificates via SDS.
**Added** enhancements to the `EnvoyFiltier` API such that all configuration can be added or updated.
**Fixed** Sidecar proxy readiness checks now check Envoy's readiness status.
**Fixed** issues with protocols like MySQL and MongoDB where the service communicates over the network first in permissive mutual TLS mode.
**Improved** Redis load balancer defaults to `MAGLEV` when using the Redis proxy.
**Improved** traffic management to direct traffic to the same region and zone.
**Improved** Pilot performance.  CPU utilization may be up to 10 times lower.
**Improved** the capabilities of `ServiceEntries` to enable the same hostname in different namespaces.
**Improved** the capability of the Sidecar API to customize `OutboundTrafficPolicy`.

## Security

**Added** a unified logging pattern to Citadel agent.
**Added** metrics into Citadel agent to monitor SDS push.
**Added** the capability to ingress gateway to provide client CA certificates when using SDS.
**Added** the capability for trust domain validation when sidecars use mutual TLS.
**Added** the labels `ca.istio.io/env` and `ca.istio.io/override`  to allow operators to control service account secret generation by namespace.
**Removed** integration with Vault CA temporarily. This was caused by SDS requirements and will be reintroduced in a new release.
**Improved** the performance of secrets handling in the sidecars by introducing SDS.
**Improved** security and reliability by enabling the the Envoy JWT filter by default.
**Improved** the reliability of SDS by requiring Kubernetes 1.13. Please be aware that while Istio supports Kubernetes 1.12, SDS [requires Kubernetes 1.13](/blog/2019/trustworthy-jwt-sds).

## Telemetry

**Added** support for Envoy gRPC Access Log Service [ALS](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/service/accesslog/v2/als.proto#grpc-access-log-service-als).
**Added** a Grafana dashboard for Citadel monitoring.
**Added** [metrics](/reference/commands/sidecar-injector/#metrics) for monitoring the sidecar injector webhook.
**Added** control plane metrics to monitor Istio configuration state.
**Added** telemetry reporting for traffic destined to `Passthrough` and `BlackHole` cluster.
**Added** alpha support for in-proxy generation of service metrics using Prometheus.
**Added** alpha support for environmental metadata in Envoy node metadata.
**Added** alpha support for Proxy Metadata Exchange.
**Added** alpha support for OpenCensus trace driver.
**Improved** the mesh dashboard to provide monitoring of Istio configuration state.
**Improved** the Pilot dashboard to expose additional key metrics to more clearly identify errors.
**Removed** deprecated Adapter and Template custom resource definitions.
**Deprecated** Mixer adapters. Extensions are expected to begin transition to new extension model. Legacy Mixer integration support will be maintained for 1.3 and 1.4.
**Deprecated** Deprecated HTTP API Spec. The support for producing API attributes will be be removed in Istio 1.4.

## Policy

**Improved** rate limit enforcement to allow communication when the quota backend is unavailable.

## Configuration Management

**Added** the ability to configure Galley to use newer configuration processing.
**Fixed** an issue in Galley where too many gRPC pings close connections.
**Improved** Galley to avoid control plane upgrade failures.


## istioctl

**Added** many new istioctl experimental subcommands.
- istioctl kube-uninject -f <descriptor.yaml> The inverse of kube-inject; removes Istio configuration from a Deployment descriptor.
- istioctl describe pod <pod> Produce description of the Istio configuration affecting a pod
- istioctl manifest apply Generates and applies Istio install manifest
- istioctl manifest diff Show the the difference between two Istio manifests
- istioctl manifest generate Generate Istio install manifest
- istioctl manifest migrate Convert Helm install values to IstioControlPlane format
- istioctl manifest versions List supported Istio versions
- istioctl profile diff Show the difference between two Istio profiles
- istioctl profile dump Show an Istio configuration profile
- istioctl profile list Lists Istio configurations
- istioctl add-to-mesh add local Kubernetes service or remote services(eg: services on VM) into Istio service mesh
- istioctl remove-from-mesh remove local Kubernetes service or remote services(eg: services on VM) from Istio service
**Improved** the istioctl experimental subcommands metrics, convert-ingress, and dashboard such that they are now supported Istio features.
