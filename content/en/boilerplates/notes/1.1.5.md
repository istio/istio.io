## Bug fixes

- Add additional validation to Pilot to reject gateway configuration with overlapping hosts matches ([Issue 13717](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/13717)).
- Build against the latest stable version of `istio-cni` instead of the latest daily build ([Issue 13171](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/13171)).

## Small enhancements

- Add additional logging to help diagnose hostname resolution failures ([Issue 13581](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/13581)).
- Improve ease of installing `prometheus` by removing unnecessary use of `busybox` image ([Issue 13501](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/13501)).
- Make Pilot Agent's certificate paths configurable ([Issue 11984](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/11984)).
