The Helm charts for `base` and `istiod` used
in this guide are the same as those used when
installing Istio via [Istioctl](/docs/setup/install/istioctl/) or the
[Operator](/docs/setup/install/operator/).
However installations via Istioctl and the Operator use a different [gateway chart]({{< github_tree >}}/manifests/charts/gateways/istio-ingress) to the [chart]({{< github_tree >}}/manifests/charts/gateway) described in this guide
