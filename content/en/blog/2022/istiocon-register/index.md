IstioCon 2022 will be an industry-focused event, a platform to connect contributors and users to discuss uses of Istio in different architectural setups, what are some limitations, and where to take the project next. The main focus will be in end-user companies, as we look forward to sharing a diversity of case studies showing how to use Istio in production. The content will be categorized according to expertise level.

This community-led event also has an interactive social hour to take the load off and mesh with the Istio community, vendors, and maintainers. Participation in the event is free of charge, [register today](https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2022/) for a chance to get the conference t-shirt!
