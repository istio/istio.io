IstioDay Europe 2023, set for April 18, will be the first ever in-person conference for Istio, the industry’s [most popular service mesh](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf), collocated with KubeCon Europe. Istio, which is currently [an incubating project at CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/projects/istio/) will celebrate its sixth birthday at IstioDay, connecting community members across the globe with Istio’s ecosystem. Visit the [conference website](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/cncf-hosted-co-located-events/istio-day/) for all the information related to the event.

IstioDay is the perfect opportunity to showcase lessons learned from running Istio in production, hands-on experiences from the Istio community, and will feature maintainers from across the Istio ecosystem. IstioDay will include real world examples, case studies, and success stories that can inspire newcomers to use Istio in production. The content will range from introductory to advanced levels, split into four main topic tracks:

* **New Features:** New standards, new extensions and how to address problems that are interesting to tackle
* **Case Studies:** Observability, traceability, and other things built on top of Istio.
* **Istio Recipes:** How Istio works, with deep-dives into performance, cost, and multi-cloud environments.
* **Project Updates:** The evolution of Istio, and the latest updates from the project maintainers.

At this time, we encourage Istio users, developers, partners, and advocates to [submit a session proposal through the conference’s CFP portal](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/cncf-hosted-co-located-events/cfp-colocated-events/), which is scheduled to close on Feb 12. Choose from the following formats to submit a session proposal for IstioDay:

* **Presentation:** 25 minutes, 1 or 2 speaker(s) presenting a topic
* **Panel Discussion:** 35 minutes of discussion among 3 to 5 speakers
* **Lighting Talk:** A brief 5-minute presentation, maximum of 1 speaker

At KubeCon Europe, the Istio community also has an interactive social hour to take the load off and mesh with the Istio community, vendors, and maintainers. IstioDay is one of the `KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe CNCF-hosted Co-located Events`. In-person attendees will now have the option to register for an `All-Access In-Person KubeCon + CloudNativeCon pass` that will include entry to all `CNCF-hosted co-located events + KubeCon + CloudNativeCon`.

The most exciting factor this KubeCon is that the accepted co-located event speakers will receive a complimentary `All-Access In-Person ticket`, providing free access to all `CNCF-hosted co-located events` and `KubeCon + CloudNativeCon`.

Do not forget to take a look at [the dates to remember section](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/cncf-hosted-co-located-events/cfp-colocated-events/#general-info), and do not miss the deadline. Stay tuned to hear more about the event, and we hope you can join us at IstioDay at KubeCon Amsterdam, April 18, 2023!
