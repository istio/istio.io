Istio is sailing up the canals this April! We are delighted to announce [Istio Day Europe 2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/cncf-hosted-co-located-events/istio-day/), a "Day 0" event co-located with [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe).

Istio Day is the perfect opportunity to meet the Istio maintainers and contributors in person, and hear from users why Istio is constantly ranked the #1 service mesh in production.

## Submit a talk

We now encourage Istio users, developers, partners, and advocates to [submit a session proposal](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/cncf-hosted-co-located-events/cfp-colocated-events/) through the CNCF event portal, which is open until **February 12**.

We want to see real world examples, case studies, and success stories that can inspire newcomers to use Istio in production. The content will cover introductory to advanced levels, split into four main topic tracks:

* **New Features:** What have you been working on that the community should know about?
* **Case Studies:** How have you built a platform or service on top of Istio?
* **Istio Recipes:** How you can solve a specific business problem using Istio.
* **Project Updates:** The evolution of Istio, and the latest updates from the project maintainers.

You can pick one of these formats to submit a session proposal:

* **Presentation:** 25 minutes, 1 or 2 speaker(s) presenting a topic
* **Panel Discussion:** 35 minutes of discussion among 3 to 5 speakers
* **Lightning Talk:** A brief 5-minute presentation, maximum of 1 speaker

Accepted speakers will receive a complimentary All-Access In-Person ticket for *all four days* of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon.

## Sponsor the event

Do you want to put your product or service in front of the most discerning Cloud Native users: those who demand *25% more conference* than the crowd? Check out [page 11 of the CNCF events prospectus](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sponsor-cncf-2023-012523.pdf) to learn more.

## Register to attend

[Istio Day is a CNCF-hosted co-located event](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/cncf-hosted-co-located-events/istio-day/) on 18 April 2023. KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in-person attendees now have the option to [buy an All-Access ticket](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/register/), which includes entry to all the Day 0 events, as well as the main three days of the conference.  You must be attending KubeCon to attend Istio Day, but virtual registration options are available, and the recordings will be posted to YouTube soon after the event.

For those of you who can't make it, keep your eyes peeled for announcements of IstioCon 2023 and Istio Day North America later this year.

Stay tuned to hear more about the event, and we hope you can join us at Istio Day Europe!
