If you are using Istio to handle application-originated traffic to destinations outside of the mesh, you're probably familiar with the concept of egress gateways.
Egress gateways can be used to monitor and forward traffic from mesh-internal applications to locations outside of the mesh.
This is a useful feature if your system is operating in a restricted
environment and you want to control what can be reached on the public internet from your mesh.

The use-case of configuring an egress gateway to handle arbitrary wildcard domains had been included in the [official Istio docs](https://archive.istio.io/v1.13/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress/wildcard-egress-hosts/#wildcard-configuration-for-arbitrary-domains) up until version 1.13, but was subsequently removed because the documented solution was not officially supported or recommended and was subject to breakage in future versions of Istio.
Nevertheless, the old solution was still usable with Istio versions before 1.20. Istio 1.20, however, dropped some Envoy functionality that was required for the approach to work.

This post attempts to describe how we resolved the issue and filled the gap with a similar approach using Istio version-independent components and Envoy features, but without the need for a separate Nginx SNI proxy.
Our approach allows users of the old solution to seamlessly migrate configurations before their systems face the breaking changes in Istio 1.20.

## Problem to solve

The currently documented egress gateway use-cases rely on the fact that the target of the traffic
(the hostname) is statically configured in a `VirtualService`, telling Envoy in the egress gateway pod where to TCP proxy
the matching outbound connections. You can use multiple, and even wildcard, DNS names to match the routing criteria, but you
are not able to route the traffic to the exact location specified in the application request. For example you can match traffic for targets
`*.wikipedia.org`, but you then need to forward the traffic to a single final target, e.g., `en.wikipedia.org`. If there is another
service, e.g., `anyservice.wikipedia.org`, that is not hosted by the same server(s) as `en.wikipedia.org`, traffic to that host will fail because, even though the target hostname in the
TLS handshake of the HTTP payload contains `anyservice.wikipedia.org`, the `en.wikipedia.org` servers will not be be able to serve the request.

The solution to this problem at a high level is to inspect the original server name (SNI extension) in the application TLS handshake (which is sent
in plain-text, so no TLS termination or other man-in-the-middle operation is needed) in every new gateway connection and use it as
the target to dynamically TCP proxy the traffic leaving the gateway.

## Further security measures

When restricting egress traffic via egress gateways, we need to lock down the egress gateways so that they can only be used
by clients within the mesh. This is achieved by enforcing `ISTIO_MUTUAL` (mTLS peer authentication) between the application
sidecar and the gateway. That means that there will be two layers of TLS on the application L7 payload. One that is the application
originated end-to-end TLS session terminated by the final remote target, and another one that is the Istio mTLS session.

Another thing to keep in mind is that in order to mitigate any potential application pod corruption, the application sidecar and the gateway should both perform hostname list checks.
This way, any compromised application pod will still only be able to access the allowed targets and nothing more.

## Low-level Envoy programming to the rescue

Recent Envoy releases include a dynamic TCP forward proxy solution that uses the SNI header on a per-
connection basis to determine the target of an application request. While an Istio `VirtualService` cannot configure a target like this, we are able to use
`EnvoyFilter`s to alter the Istio generated routing instructions so that the SNI header is used to determine the target.

To make it all work, we start by configuring a custom egress gateway to listen for the outbound traffic. Using
a `DestinationRule` and a `VirtualService` we instruct the application sidecars to route the traffic (for a selected
list of hostnames) to that gateway, using Istio mTLS. On the gateway pod side we build the SNI forwarder with the
`EnvoyFilter`s, mentioned above, introducing internal Envoy listeners and clusters to make it all work. Finally, we patch the
internal destination of the gateway-implemented TCP proxy to the internal SNI forwarder.

The end-to-end request flow is shown in the following diagram:

## Deploy the sample

In order to deploy the sample configuration, start by creating the `istio-egress` namespace and then use the following YAML to deploy an egress gateway, along with some RBAC
and its `Service`. We use the gateway injection method to create the gateway in this example but, depending on your install method, you may want to
deploy it differently (for example, using an `IstioOperator` CR or using Helm).

Check the logs of `istiod` and the gateway pod for any errors of warnings. If all goes well, your mesh sidecars are now routing
`*.wikipedia.org` towards your gateway pod, while the gateway pod is routing to the exact remote host based on the application
request.

## Testing

Following other examples, we will use the sleep pod. Assuming there is automatic sidecar injection in your default namespace, deploy
the test app:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl apply -f {{< github_file >}}/samples/sleep/sleep.yaml
{{< /text >}}

Get your pod and gateway name:

{{< text bash >}}
$ export SOURCE_POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})
$ export GATEWAY_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n istio-egress -l istio=egressgateway -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})
{{< /text >}}

Test that you are able to connect to a `wikipedia.org` site:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl exec "$SOURCE_POD" -c sleep -- sh -c 'curl -s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"; curl -s https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hauptseite | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"'
<title>Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<title>Wikipedia ‚Äì Die freie Enzyklop√§die</title>
{{< /text >}}

We could reach both English and German Wikipedia, great! To have something to compare, let's check another site:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl exec "$SOURCE_POD" -c sleep -- sh -c 'curl -s https://cloud.ibm.com/login | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"'
<title>IBM Cloud</title>
{{< /text >}}

Now that we turned on access logging globally (with the `Telemetry` CR in the manifest), we can double-check what happened in the proxies.

First, check the gateway:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl logs -n istio-egress $GATEWAY_POD

There are four log entries, representing two of the three curl requests. Each pair shows how a single request is flowing through the envoy traffic processing pipeline twice.
They are printed in reverse order, but we can see the 2nd and the 4th line saying connection arrived to the gateway service and passed through the internal `sni_cluster` target.
The 1st and 3rd line shows the final target is determined from the inner SNI header. This is the one set by the original application.
Then it is forwarded to `dynamic_forward_proxy_cluster` which is the final entity in envoy that is talking to the final remote target.

Great, but where is the third request to IBM Cloud? Let's check the sidecar logs:

{{< text bash >}}

{{< /text >}}

As you can see, Wikipedia requests were sent through the gateway, while the request towards IBM Cloud went straight out from the application pod to the internet. This is indicated with the `PassthroughCluster` log.

## Conclusion

We implemented a selective routing for egress HTTPS/TLS traffic with egress gateways, supporting arbitrary and wildcard domain names. Of course the example
can be extended with HA requirements (i.e. with adding zone aware gateway `Deployment`s, etc.). From here you are free to restrict the direct external
network access of your application, for example with network policies that denies traffic to tcp port 443 in the application namespace.
Once that is in place, the application cannot directly talk to the public network, only through the gateway, which is limited to a predefined set of remote hostnames.

The solution scales easily. You can pick up multiple domain names to the list, and they are allow-listed as soon as you roll it out!
No need to set up per domain `VirtualService`s or other routing details. Beware the list appears at multiple places, so if you use
some tooling for CI/CD (i.e. Kustomize), the domain name list is better to be extracted to a single place, from where you render into the final
places.

That was all! I hope it was helpful.
If you are an existing user of the previous nginx based solution,
you are now free to migrate to this approach before upgrading to Istio 1.20, which would disrupt your current setup.

Happy SNI routing!
