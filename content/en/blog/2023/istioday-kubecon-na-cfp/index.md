We all had a blast at [Istio Day Europe](/blog/2023/istio-at-kubecon-eu/) in April. The event was incredibly well received, but organizers and attendees alike felt that a half-day was not enough to showcase all that Istio has to offer. Due to the overwhelming response, we are glad to share with all of you that [Istio Day North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/istio-day/) is going to be a **full-day** event, co-located with KubeCon North America in Chicago.

## Submit a talk

We now encourage Istio users, developers, partners, and advocates to [submit a session proposal](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/cfp-colocated-events/) through the CNCF event portal, which is open until **August 6th**.

We want to see real world examples, case studies, and success stories that can inspire newcomers to use Istio in production. The content will cover introductory to advanced levels, split into four main topic tracks:

* **New Features:** What have you been working on that the community should know about?
* **Case Studies:** How have you built a platform or service on top of Istio?
* **Istio Recipes:** How you can solve a specific business problem using Istio.
* **Project Updates:** The evolution of Istio, and the latest updates from the project maintainers.

You can pick one of these formats to submit a session proposal:

* **Presentation:** 25 minutes, 1 or 2 speaker(s) presenting a topic
* **Panel Discussion:** 35 minutes of discussion among 3 to 5 speakers
* **Lightning Talk:** A brief 5-minute presentation, maximum of 1 speaker

Accepted speakers will receive a complimentary All-Access In-Person ticket for *all four days* of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon.
