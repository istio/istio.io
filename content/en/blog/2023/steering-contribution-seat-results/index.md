The [Istio Steering Committee](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/README.md) consists of 9 Contribution Seats, proportionally allocated based on corporate contributions to the project, and 4 elected Community Seats.

Last year, we [elected the four members](/blog/2022/steering-election-results/) to the community seats. It's now time to reward the companies who fuel our growth by selecting the [Contribution Seat] members. As per the [Steering charter](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/CHARTER.md), every February we look at which companies have made the most contributions to Istio based on an [annually agreed metric](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/CONTRIBUTION-FORMULA.md).

According to our [seat allocation process](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IIms6OT1DgJ_lbn5433sy5wvqNBIIQgQHoWZvpShSXk/edit#gid=1365082320), this year Google will be allocated 5 seats and IBM/Red Hat will be allocated 2. As the third largest contributor to Istio in the last 12 months, we are pleased to announce that Huawei has earned two Contribution Seats. As a result we have the following new members joining the Istio Steering Committee, in addition to the existing contributor members.

- [Cale Rath](https://github.com/ctrath) (IBM)
- [Justin Pettit](https://github.com/justinpettit) (Google)
- [John Howard](https://github.com/howardjohn) (Google)
- [Zhonghu Xu](https://github.com/hzxuzhonghu) (Huawei)

Our sincerest thanks to Srihari Angaluri, Kebe Liu and Louis Ryan, all long-time contributors to the Istio project, whose terms have come to an end.
