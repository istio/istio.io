The open source and cloud native community gathered from 6th to 9th November in Chicago for the last KubeCon of 2023. The four-day conference, organized by
the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, was "twice the fun" for Istio, as we grew from a half day event in Europe in April 2023 to a full day CNCF co-located
"Istio Day" in North America. To add to the excitement, Istio Day North America marks our first event as a CNCF graduated project. With Istio Day North
America, it is a WRAP for the major Istio events for 2023.  [Istio Day Europe](/blog/2023/istio-at-kubecon-eu/) was held in April, and alongside our
[Virtual IstioCon 2023](https://events.istio.io/) event, [IstioCon China 2023](/blog/2023/istiocon-china/) was held on September 26 in Shanghai, China.

Istio Day kicked off with an opening keynote from the Program Committee chairs, Faseela K and Zack Butcher. The opening keynote made sure to recognize the day-to-day efforts of our contributors, maintainers, release managers, and users, with some awards for our top contributors and community helpers. Rob Salmond and Andrea Ma were recognized for their selfless efforts to the Istio community, and the top 20 contributors in the last 6 months were also
appreciated.

The opening keynote also announced the availability of [the Istio Certified Associate (ICA) exam](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/11/06/introducing-the-istio-certified-associate-ica-certification-for-microservices-management/) for enrollment starting November 6th. We were also glad to showcase [a small video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5baPkXZEMU) of many of our contributors, vendors and end-users congratulating us for the CNCF graduation!

The keynote was followed by [an end user talk by Kush Trivedi and Khushboo Mittal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk0k8uhdyaA) from DevRev about their usage of Istio ServiceMesh. We had our much awaited session on ["Architect Ambient for Scale"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S39yo6ZJ4iM), from John Howard, which stirred some interesting discussions in the community. We also had an interesting talk showcasing the collaboration between Lilt and Intel about ["Scaling AI powered translation services using Istio"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFJyLbHros0). After this we stepped into another [end user talk from Intuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe38vEygOqk) where Karim Lakhani explained about Intuit’s modern SaaS platform deploying multiple cloud native projects including Istio. The audience were excited when Mitch Connors and Christian Hernandez did [a live demo of  upgrading Istio Ambient Mesh with Argo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o71PJAqy4P8) on a live public site, with a publicly accessible availability monitor.

The event witnessed more focus on security as we moved forward to subsequent talks where Jackie Elliot from Microsoft took a dig at ["Istio Identity"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjmUDNXyckQ),  followed by a lightning talk from Kush Mansing from Speedscale showing [the impacts of running services with arbitrary code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6Y9JLnej0o) on Istio. We also had another [lightning talk from Xiangfeng Zhu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHUXvtSWdtQ), who is a PhD student at  University of Washington, where he showcased a tool developed to analyze and predict the performance overheads of Istio.

The [talk from the Kiali maintainers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX-Sym2EkGI) Jay Shaughnessy and Nick Fox, was very interesting, as it demonstrated many advanced ways of using Kiali for better debugging of Istio use cases. Ekansh Gupta from Zeta, and Nirupama Singh from Reskill pitched in another [end user talk explaining the best practices while upgrading Istio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0sESwwm9c) in their production deployments. Istio multi-cluster is always a hot topic, and Lukonde Mwila and Ovidiu from AWS nailed it with perfection in the talk ["Bridging trust between multi-cluster meshes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIVmVIJlLVw). We also had [an interactive panel discussion with the Istio TOC Members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUiL2BPXds), where a lot of questions came in from the audience, and the good attendance for the discussion was a testament to the continued popularity of Istio. Istio Day concluded with [a brilliant workshop on getting started with Ambient Mesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjBSM-3dOY) from Christian Posta and Jim Barton from Solo.io, which is the hot topic all the audience were looking forward to. The slides for all the sessions can be found in the [IstioDay NA 2023 schedule](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/istio-day/#thank-you-for-attending).

Istio’s presence at the conference did not end with Istio Day. The first day keynote of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon started with a project update video from Mitch Connors. It was also a proud moment for us, when two of our steering committee members,Lin Sun and Faseela K, bagged the CNCF community ["Chop Wood Carry Water" award](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2023/11/08/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-2023-community-awards-winners/), presented by Chris Aniszczyk, CTO CNCF, at the second day keynote.

Some of our maintainers and contributors made it to the CNCF Fall 2023 Ambassadors list as well, Lin Sun, Mitch Connors and Faseela K, to name a few.

The maintainer track session at KubeCon for Istio presented by TOC members John Howard and Louis Ryan grabbed great attention as they talked about the current ongoing efforts and future roadmap of Istio. The talk, and the size of the audience, underlined why Istio continues to be the most popular service mesh in the industry.

The Contribfest session on "Istio Hands-on Development and Contribution Workshop" by Lin Sun, Eric Van Norman, Steven Landow and Faseela K was also well received. It was great to see so many people interested in contributing to Istio and pushing their first Istio Pull Request at the end of the workshop.

The much awaited panel discussion on "Service Mesh Battle Scars: Technology, Timing and Tradeoffs" which was led by the maintainers from the leading CNCF Service Mesh projects, had a huge crowd in attendance and a lot of interesting discussions.

Istio had a full time kiosk in the project pavilion at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2023 , with the majority of questions asked around the schedule for Ambient Mesh being production ready.

We are glad that the major question which we had at the Istio kiosk in Europe about *CNCF graduation* is already answered, and we assure everyone that we are working on the Ambient Mesh promotion with the same level of seriousness. Many of our members and maintainers offered support at the booth, helping us answer all the questions from our users.

Another highlight about the Istio kiosk this time was that we had our new Istio T-shirts sponsored by Microsoft, Solo.io, Tetrate and Stackgenie for everyone to grab.
