## Istio Day and Key Sessions

- **Join us at [Istio Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/istio-day/)** on **Monday, November 10 2025** — a full-day, community-focused event. Istio Day will feature sessions on AI readiness for service meshes, scaling Istio across multicluster environments with Ambient Mesh, validating and testing Istio setups, optimizing autoscaling, running stateful workloads like databases in Istio, and zero-downtime migrations to modern Gateway APIs. Attendees will also have hands-on workshops and opportunities to meet maintainers and contributors.
- **Catch the TOC session:** [*Istio Project Updates: AI Inference, Ambient Multicluster & Default Deny*](https://sched.co/27NoI) — hear about the latest features, what the community has been working on, and a preview of the 2026 roadmap.
- **Participate in Istio ContribFest:** [*From Farm (Fork) To Table (Feature): Growing Your First (Free-range Organic) Istio PR*](https://sched.co/27Nku) — a perfect session for newcomers and aspiring contributors to jump into the codebase and community.
