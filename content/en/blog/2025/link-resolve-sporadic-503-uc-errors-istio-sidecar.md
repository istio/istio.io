One of our clients observed sporadic 503 UC Errors on the Istio sidecar. This issue persisted for all the inbound requests across environments such as production, integration, and staging. We analyzed application logs, proxy logs, and tcpdump of the loopback interface to identify the root cause. In the post, I summarize our observations and share ways to avoid the issue.
