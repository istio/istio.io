The Istio Steering Committee oversees the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, branding, marketing, and working with the CNCF.

Every year, we [estimate the proportion](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/CONTRIBUTION-FORMULA.md) of the [hundreds of companies that have contributed to Istio in the past year](https://istio.devstats.cncf.io/d/5/companies-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions), and uses that metric to proportionally allocate the nine Contribution Seats on our Steering Committee.

After that, four Community Seats are voted for by our project members, with candidates being from companies that did not receive Contribution Seats.

In February, we [announced the Contribution Seat allocation, and invited candidates to stand for the Community Seat elections](../steering-election/).
As the election officer, I am pleased to announce the results of that election, as well as the individuals who will represent the top contributors.

## Community Seats

Four excellent candidates stood for our four open seats, and thus all are elected unopposed:

- [Faseela K](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/elections/2025/candidate-kfaseela.md), Ericsson Software Technology
- [Wilson Wu](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/elections/2025/candidate-wilsonwu.md), DaoCloud
- [Rob Cernich](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/elections/2025/candidate-rcernich.md), Red Hat
- [Pratima Nambiar](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/elections/2025/candidate-pnambiarsf.md), Salesforce

Wilson is a top 20 contributor to Istio, and a leader in the localization of Istio's documentation into Chinese. The three other candidates have all previously served on the Steering Committee.

## Contribution Seats

Our supporting companies have made their choices for the nine Contribution Seats. They will be held by:

- [Craig Box](https://github.com/craigbox) (Solo.io)
- [Zack Butcher](https://github.com/ZackButcher) (Tetrate)
- [John Howard](https://github.com/howardjohn) (Solo.io)
- [Idit Levine](https://github.com/ilevine) (Solo.io)
- [Keith Mattix](https://github.com/keithmattix) (Microsoft)
- [Justin Pettit](https://github.com/justinpettit) (Google)
- [Louis Ryan](https://github.com/louiscryan) (Solo.io)
- [Lin Sun](https://github.com/linsun) (Solo.io)
- [Zhonghu Xu](https://github.com/hzxuzhonghu) (Huawei)

## Seating the new committee

On behalf of the Steering Committee, I wish to congratulate our new and returning members. This group will serve for one year, starting this week.

We would also like to extend our heartfelt thanks to Iris Ding, Arunkumar Jayaraman, Abhi Joglekar, Kebe Liu and Jamie Longmuir, whose terms have now ended.

The new team will continue to grow and improve Istio as a successful and sustainable open source project. We encourage everyone to [get involved in the Istio community](/get-involved/), and help us shape the future of the world's most popular service mesh.
