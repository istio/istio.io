Last month, we [announced a revision to our Steering Committee charter](../steering-changes/), opening up governance roles to more contributors and community members. The Steering Committee now consists of 9 proportionally-allocated Contribution Seats, and 4 elected Community Seats.

We have now concluded our [inaugural election](https://github.com/istio/community/tree/master/steering/elections/2020) for the Community Seats, and we're excited to welcome the following new members to the Committee:

- [Neeraj Poddar](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/elections/2020/nrjpoddar.md) (Aspen Mesh)
- [Zack Butcher](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/elections/2020/zackbutcher.md) (Tetrate)
- [Christian Posta](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/elections/2020/ceposta.md) (Solo.io)
- [Zhonghu Xu](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/elections/2020/hzxuzhonghu.md) (Huawei)

They join Contribution Seat holders from Google, IBM/Red Hat and Salesforce. We now have representation from 7 organizations on Steering, reflecting the breadth of our contributor ecosystem.

Thank you to everyone who participated in the election process. The next election will be in July 2021.
