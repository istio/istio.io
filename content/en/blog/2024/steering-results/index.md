The Istio Steering Committee oversees the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, branding, marketing, and working with the CNCF.

Every year, the leaders in the Istio project [estimate the proportion](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/CONTRIBUTION-FORMULA.md) of the [hundreds of companies that have contributed to Istio in the past year](https://istio.devstats.cncf.io/d/5/companies-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions), and uses that metric to proportionally allocate nine Contribution Seats on our Steering Committee.

Then, four Community Seats are voted for by our project members, with candidates being from companies that did not receive Contribution Seats.

We are pleased to share the result of this year's calculation, and changes to our Community Seat holders as a result.

## Contribution seats

The calculation for the 2024-2025 term brings the most diverse set of company representation ever in the Contribution Seats, with five companies[^1] represented:

        <tr>
            <th>Company</th>
            <th>Seat allocation</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Google</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Solo.io</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>IBM/Red Hat</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DaoCloud</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Huawei</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The full allocation can be seen in our [formula spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OIwf11xdL3VHi18uhOnHMwQnlXBS22vvhL0m1qraIds/edit#gid=1365082320).

## Community seats

As a result of this year's calculation, two of our Community Seat holders move to Contribution Seats. This creates two extra vacancies, which are allocated to the runners-up of our last election[^2].

We are pleased to welcome our two newest Community Seat holders, Mitch Connors from Aviatrix and Keith Mattix from Microsoft. Both are highly active maintainers and leaders in the project, and we are delighted to have them join the Steering Committee.

## Proposed changes to election timing

Our charter currently allocates Contribution Seats in February and holds the Community Seat election in July. We previously [anticipated a situation](https://github.com/istio/community/pull/609#issuecomment-877302152) where people would change seat types mid-term, and this has now come to pass.

We will therefore be voting on a change to our Charter which will move our Community Seat elections to February, to be held immediately after the allocation of Contribution Seats. It is our intention that the next annual election be held in February 2025.

## The full group

Following these changes, we now have representation from nine companies:

Our sincerest thanks to Ameer Abbas, April Kyle Nassi, Cale Rath and Chaomeng Zhang, whose terms have come to an end.

The Steering Committee wishes to thank its members, old and new, and looks forward to continue to grow and improve Istio as a successful and sustainable open source project. We encourage everyone to get involved in the Istio community by contributing, voting, and helping us shape the future of cloud native networking.

[^1]: [Our Steering Committee charter](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/CHARTER.md#membership-and-voting) considers groups of companies as one, for the purposes of allocation of seats. This means we group IBM and Red Hat together as a single entity.
[^2]: The first runner-up from the election was Kebe Liu from DaoCloud, who will join with their newly allocated Contribution Seat.
