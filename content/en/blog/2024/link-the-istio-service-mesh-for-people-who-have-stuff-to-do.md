I recently made a small contribution to Istio, an open-source service mesh project. My contribution involved adding a few tests for one of the Istio CLI commands. If you want to check out the details, you can find the pull request here. It wasn't a huge change, but it was a great learning experience. Working on Istio helped me understand service meshes at a deeper level. I'm excited to contribute more. In this post, I'll explain what Istio is, why it's useful, and how it works.
