Having sailed into, and proudly graduated within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2023, Istio joined the [CNCF Phippy family’s](https://www.cncf.io/phippy/) mission to demystify and simplify cloud native computing in March 2024, with our Indo-Pacific Bottlenose, Izzy Dolphin. Ever since Istio contributed Izzy to the Phippy family, all the Istio lovers worldwide were curiously awaiting the first Phippy book featuring this cute dolphin. And here it is! The Istio Steering Committee is excited to unveil Izzy’s adventure sail with the Phippy family at [KubeCon North America 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/) in Salt Lake City! The first illustrated children’s book for Istio is now officially launched and available at the CNCF store at KubeCon NA in Salt Lake City and the [online store](https://store.cncf.io) shortly after. And it is double the delight to have the book launched at the 10 year anniversary of Kubernetes, with a storyline that revolves around captain Kube’s birthday celebration.

## Why the book?

The authors of the book and Istio maintainers, Faseela and Lin, both have kids and often found themselves in a touch spot to explain what they do at work, particularly in a context that can make sense to kids. The kids have read the Illustrated Children’s Guide to Kubernetes and enjoyed it but are curious to learn more about other Phippy characters and their roles and responsibilities.

## What is the book about?

Captain Kube hosts a grand birthday bash on a special cruise with Phippy and friends, however the ship is in great danger! But what is to worry, when Izzy is in charge of the security!
Join Izzy's smart and adventurous chase of the pirates who want to spoil Captain Kube's birthday bash.

## Who is the book for?

This book is the answer to each one of you, who has at least once encountered those curious little eyes, who keep asking you what "Service Mesh" is. This is also a great gift for anyone who needs to understand what "Istio" is or who thinks "Istio is complex to understand".

## Acknowledgement

The Istio Steering Committee would like to thank our maintainers Faseela K, and Lin Sun for co-authoring this amazing book. Suri Patel and Alex Davy from CNCF have done a wonderful job with the design and background illustrations giving life to the story-line. Last but not least, a huge thanks to Katie Greenley for her support throughout the process to make sure the book was released on time to join the grand celebration of the largest international conference.

We are planning for a book signing event at the subsequent [KubeCon EU 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) too, make sure to grab a free copy of the book from our authors in London!

Next time you’re breaking down the ServiceMesh concepts for people who don’t share your background knowledge, how about using Izzy?
Over the years Istio has made substantial strides in simplifying the complex problem of cloud native networking. We understand that these concepts remain complicated for many, and that is why we are proud to join Phippy’s mission to talk about tech in an accessible, straight-forward manner. We would like to open the doors of service mesh technology to more folks than ever before through Izzy and enable you to join `#teamcloudnative`! We hope you enjoy our new book. Happy reading!
