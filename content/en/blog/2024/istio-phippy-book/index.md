Earlier this year, [we added Izzy Dolphin, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose](/blog/2024/istio-phippy/) to the [CNCF "Phippy and Friends" family](https://www.cncf.io/phippy/). Ever since then, Istio lovers worldwide have been eagerly awaiting the first children's book featuring our cute dolphin.

And here it is!

The Istio project is excited to unveil Izzy’s adventure sailing with the Phippy family at [KubeCon North America 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/) this week, as together we celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Kubernetes. Copies are available at the the CNCF Store, or on the [online store](https://store.cncf.io) shortly after the event.

Captain Kube hosts a grand birthday bash on a special cruise with Phippy and her friends, however the ship is in great danger! But there is nothing to worry about, when Izzy is in charge of the security! Join Izzy's smart and adventurous chase of the pirates who want to spoil Captain Kube's birthday bash.

## Why the book?

The co-authors of the book, Faseela K. and Lin Sun, are both Istio maintainers and parents. They have often found themselves in a tough spot explaining what they do at work, particularly in a context that makes sense to younger people. Their children read and enjoyed [the Illustrated Children’s Guide to Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/phippy/the-childrens-illustrated-guide-to-kubernetes/) but were curious to learn more about the other  characters and their roles and responsibilities!

This book is for every one who has encountered curious little eyes that keep asking you what "Service Mesh" is. It's also a great gift for anyone of any age who needs to understand what Istio is, or who thinks that service mesh is too complex.

## Acknowledgements

The Istio Steering Committee would like to thank Faseela and Lin for writing this amazing book. Suri Patel and Alex Davy from CNCF did a wonderful job with the design and illustrations, bringing the story to life. Last, but not least, a huge thanks to Katie Greenley for her support throughout the process to make sure the book was released on time for Captain Kube's birthday celebrations at our community's largest international conference.

We are planning a book signing event at next year's [KubeCon EU in London](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/).

Happy reading!
