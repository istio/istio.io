Welcome to the Istio blog!

To make it easier to publish your content on our website, we
[updated the content types guide](/docs/releases/contribute/add-content/#content-types).

The goal of the updated guide is to make sharing and finding content easier.

We want to make sharing timely information on Istio easy and the [Istio blog](/blog)
is a good place to start.

We welcome your posts to the blog if you think your content falls in one of the
following four categories:

-  Your post details your experience using and configuring Istio. Ideally, your
   post shares a novel experience or perspective.
-  Your post highlights Istio features.
-  Your post details how to accomplish a task or fulfill a specific use case
   using Istio.

Posting your blog is only [one PR away](/docs/releases/contribute/github/)
and, if you wish, you can [request a review](/docs/releases/contribute/review).

We look forward to reading about your Istio experience on the blog soon!
