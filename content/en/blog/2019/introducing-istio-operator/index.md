Kubernetes [operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) provide
a pattern for encoding human operational knowledge in software and are a popular way to simplify
the administration of software infrastructure components. Istio is a natural candidate for an automated
operator as it is challenging to administer.

Up until now, [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) has been the primary tool to install and upgrade Istio.
Istio 1.4 introduces a new method of [installation using {{< istioctl >}}](/docs/setup/install/istioctl/).
This new installation method builds on the strengths of Helm with the addition of the
following:

- Users only need to install one tool: `istioctl`
- All API fields are validated
- Small customizations not in the API don't require chart or API changes
- Version specific upgrade hooks can be easily and robustly implemented

The [Helm installation](https://archive.istio.io/1.4/docs/setup/install/helm/) method is in the process of deprecation. Upgrading from Istio
1.4 with a version not initially installed with Helm will also be replaced by a new
[{{< istioctl >}} upgrade feature](https://archive.istio.io/v1.4/docs/setup/upgrade/istioctl-upgrade/).

The new `istioctl` installation commands use a
[custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
to configure the installation. The custom resource is part of a new Istio operator
implementation intended to simplify the common administrative tasks of installation, upgrade,
and complex configuration changes for Istio. Validation and checking for installation and upgrade
is tightly integrated with the tools to prevent common errors and simplify troubleshooting.

## The Operator API

Every operator implementation requires a
[custom resource definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions)
to define its custom resource, that is, its API. Istio's operator API is defined by the
[`IstioControlPlane` CRD](https://archive.istio.io/v1.4/docs/reference/config/istio.operator.v1alpha12.pb/),
which is generated from an
[`IstioControlPlane` proto](https://github.com/istio/operator/blob/release-1.4/pkg/apis/istio/v1alpha2/istiocontrolplane_types.proto).
The API supports all of Istio's current [configuration profiles](/docs/setup/additional-setup/config-profiles/)
using a single field to select the profile. For example, the following `IstioControlPlane` resource
configures Istio using the `demo` profile:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha2
kind: IstioControlPlane
metadata:
  namespace: istio-operator
  name: example-istiocontrolplane
spec:
  profile: demo
{{< /text >}}

You can then customize the configuration with additional settings. For example, to disable telemetry:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha2
kind: IstioControlPlane
metadata:
  namespace: istio-operator
  name: example-istiocontrolplane
spec:
  profile: demo
  telemetry:
    enabled: false
{{< /text >}}

## Installing with {{< istioctl >}}

The recommended way to use the Istio operator API is through a new set of `istioctl` commands.
For example, to install Istio into a cluster:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl manifest apply -f <your-istiocontrolplane-customresource>
{{< /text >}}

Make changes to the installation configuration by editing the configuration file and executing
`istioctl manifest apply` again.

To upgrade to a new version of Istio:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl x upgrade -f <your-istiocontrolplane-config-changes>
{{< /text >}}

In addition to specifying the complete configuration in an `IstioControlPlane` resource,
the `istioctl` commands can also be passed individual settings using a `--set` flag:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl manifest apply --set telemetry.enabled=false
{{< /text >}}

There are also a number of other `istioctl` commands that, for example, help you list, display,
and compare configuration profiles and manifests.

Refer to the Istio [install instructions](/docs/setup/install/istioctl) for more details.

## Istio Controller (alpha)

Operator implementations use a Kubernetes controller to continuously monitor their custom resource
and apply the corresponding configuration changes. The Istio controller monitors an `IstioControlPlane`
resource and reacts to changes by updating the Istio installation configuration in the corresponding cluster.

In the 1.4 release, the Istio controller is in the alpha phase of development and not fully
integrated with `istioctl`. It is, however,
[available for experimentation](/docs/setup/install/operator/) using `kubectl` commands.
For example, to install the controller and a default version of Istio into your cluster,
run the following command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl apply -f https://<repo URL>/operator.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f https://<repo URL>/default-cr.yaml
{{< /text >}}

You can then make changes to the Istio installation configuration:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl edit istiocontrolplane example-istiocontrolplane -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}

As soon as the resource is updated, the controller will detect the changes and respond by updating
the Istio installation correspondingly.

Both the operator controller and `istioctl` commands share the same implementation. The significant
difference is the execution context. In the `istioctl` case, the operation runs in the admin userâ€™s
command execution and security context. In the controller case, a pod in the cluster runs the code
in its security context. In both cases, configuration is validated against a schema and the same correctness
checks are performed.

## Migration from Helm

To help ease the transition from previous configurations using Helm,
`istioctl` and the controller support pass-through access for the full Helm installation API.

You can pass Helm configuration options using `istioctl --set` by prepending the string `values.` to the option name.
For example, instead of this Helm command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ helm template ... --set global.mtls.enabled=true
{{< /text >}}

You can use this `istioctl` command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl manifest generate ... --set values.global.mtls.enabled=true
{{< /text >}}

You can also set Helm configuration values in an `IstioControlPlane` custom resource.
See [Customize Istio settings using Helm](/docs/setup/install/istioctl/#customize-istio-settings-using-the-helm-api)
for details.

Another feature to help with the transition from Helm is the alpha
[{{< istioctl >}} manifest migrate](/docs/reference/commands/istioctl/#istioctl-manifest-migrate) command.
This command can be used to automatically convert a Helm `values.yaml` file to a corresponding
`IstioControlPlane` configuration.

## Implementation

Several frameworks have been created to help implement operators by generating stubs for some or all of
the components. The Istio operator was created with the help of a combination of
[kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) and
[operator framework](https://github.com/operator-framework). Istio's installation now uses a proto to
describe the API such that runtime validation can be executed against a schema.

More information about the implementation can be found in the README and ARCHITECTURE documents
in the [Istio operator repository](https://github.com/istio/operator).

## Summary

Starting in Istio 1.4, Helm installation is being replaced by new `istioctl` commands using
a new operator custom resource definition, `IstioControlPlane`, for the configuration API.
An alpha controller is also available for early experimentation with the operator.

The new `istioctl` commands and operator controller both validate configuration schemas and perform a range of
checks for installation change or upgrade. These checks are tightly integrated with the tools to prevent
common errors and simplify troubleshooting.

The Istio maintainers expect that this new approach will improve the user experience during Istio
installation and upgrade, better stabilize the installation API, and help users better manage and
monitor their Istio installations.

We welcome your feedback about the new installation approach at [discuss.istio.io](https://discuss.istio.io/).
