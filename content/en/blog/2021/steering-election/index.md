Last year we [introduced a new Steering Committee charter](/blog/2020/steering-changes/), which shares governance responsibilities between Contribution Seats, selected based on contributions to the project, and Community Seats, elected by the project members. We [elected four members](/blog/2020/steering-election-results/), with the committee representing seven different companies.

It's now time to kick off our 2021 election for Community Seats. Members have two weeks to submit nominations, and voting will run from 12 to 25 July. You can learn all about the election, including how to stand and how to vote, in the [`istio/community` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/istio/community/tree/master/steering/elections/2021).

Just like last year, any [project member](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/ROLES.md#member) can stand for election.  All Istio members who have been active in the last 12 months are eligible to vote.

## Technical Oversight Committee updates

We wish to offer our thanks to Dan Berg and Joshua Blatt, both long-time contributors to the Istio project, who have recently taken new jobs outside the service mesh space. That left two vacancies on the [Istio Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) (TOC), responsible for cross-cutting product and design decisions.

TOC members are elected by the Steering Committee from the [working group leads](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/WORKING-GROUPS.md#working-group-leads), and last week we voted for two new members:

* **[John Howard](http://github.com/howardjohn)**, from Google, has become one of the most active contributors to Istio since joining the project in January 2019. He is currently a lead in the Networking working group, and has also served as an Environments working group lead and release manager for version 1.4.
* **[Brian Avery](https://github.com/brian-avery)**, from Red Hat, has been active in the Istio community for over 3 years. He served as Release Manager for Istio 1.3 and 1.6, and has remained actively involved in the Istio release process, including introducing tooling for release notes, streamlining the feature maturity process, and working on documentation testing. Most recently, Brian was a lead in the Test and Release and Product Security working groups.

Congratulations to John and Brian!

As our new TOC members step into their roles, they will be vacating their current positions as working group leads. We are always on the lookout for community members who are interested in joining, or leading, Istio working groups. If youâ€™re interested, please reach out in the working group channels [on Slack](https://slack.istio.io/), or during the [public working group meetings](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/WORKING-GROUPS.md#working-group-meetings) of your interest.
