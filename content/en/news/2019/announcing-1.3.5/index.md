## Bug fixes

- **Fixed** Envoy listener configuration for TCP headless services. ([Issue #17748](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/17748))
- **Fixed** an issue which caused stale endpoints to remain even when a deployment was scaled to 0 replicas. ([Issue #14436](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14336))
- **Fixed** Pilot to gracefully handle bad configurations for invalid custom Envoy filters. ([Issue 17266](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/17266))

## Minor enhancements

- **Added** support for Citadel to periodically check the root certificate remaining lifetime and rotate expiring root certificates. ([Issue 17059](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/17059))
- **Added** `PILOT_BLOCK_HTTP_ON_443` environment variable. If enabled, this flag will prevent HTTP services from running on port 443 in order to prevent conflicts with external HTTP services. This is disabled by default. ([Issue 16458](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/16458))
