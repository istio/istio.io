According to Istio's [support policy](/about/release-cadence/), LTS releases like 1.0 are supported for three months after the next LTS release.   Since [1.1 was released on March 19th](/news/2019/announcing-1.1/), support for 1.0 will end on June 19th, 2019.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.0, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}).  If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
