According to Istio's [support policy](/about/release-cadence/), LTS releases like 1.4 are supported for three months after the next LTS release. Since [1.5 was released on March 5th](/news/releases/1.5.x/announcing-1.5/), support for 1.4 will end on June 5th, 2020.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.4, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}).  If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
