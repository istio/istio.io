According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#supported-releases/), minor releases like 1.9 are supported for three months after the next minor release. [Istio 1.10 was released on May 18th](/news/releases/1.10.x/announcing-1.10/), and support for 1.9 will end on August 24th, 2021.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.9, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}).  If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
