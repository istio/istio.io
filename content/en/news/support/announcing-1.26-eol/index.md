According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#support-policy), minor releases like 1.26 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.28 in this case). [Istio 1.28 was released on the 5th of November, 2025](/news/releases/1.28.x/announcing-1.28/), and support for 1.26 will end on the 19th of December, 2025.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.26, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}). If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
