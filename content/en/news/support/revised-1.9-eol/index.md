Istio is [expanding](/blog/2021/extended-support/) the support window of the 1.9 release by six weeks to allow time for users to upgrade to Istio 1.10 or [directly](/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/) to Istio 1.11.  Previously, we had announced that Istio 1.9 support would end on August 24, so our new end of support date for Istio 1.9 is October 5, 2021.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.9, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio (1.11.1). If you donâ€™t do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
