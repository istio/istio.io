According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#supported-releases/), minor releases like 1.8 are supported for three months after the next minor release. Since [1.9 was released on February 9th](/news/releases/1.9.x/announcing-1.9/), support for 1.8 will end on May 12th, 2021.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.8, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}).  If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
