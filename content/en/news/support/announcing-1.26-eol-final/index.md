As [previously announced](/news/support/announcing-1.26-eol/), support for Istio 1.26 has now officially ended.

At this point we will no longer back-port fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.26. We highly recommend that
you upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}) if you haven't already.
