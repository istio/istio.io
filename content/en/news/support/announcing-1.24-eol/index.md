According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#support-policy), minor releases like 1.24 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.26 in this case). [Istio 1.26 was released on May 8th, 2025](/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26/), and support for 1.24 will end on June 19th, 2025.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.24, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}). If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
