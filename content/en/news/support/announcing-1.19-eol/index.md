According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#support-policy), minor releases like 1.19 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.21 in this case). [Istio 1.21 was released on March 13th, 2024](/news/releases/1.21.x/announcing-1.21/), and support for 1.19 will end on April 24th, 2024.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.19, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}). If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
