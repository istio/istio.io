According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#supported-releases/), LTS releases like 1.1 are supported for three months after the next LTS release.   Since [1.2 was released on June 18th](/news/releases/1.2.x/announcing-1.2/), support for 1.1 will end on September 19th, 2019.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.1, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}).  If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
