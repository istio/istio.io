According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#support-policy), minor releases like 1.23 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.25 in this case). [Istio 1.25 was released on March 3rd, 2025](/news/releases/1.24.x/announcing-1.24/), and support for 1.23 will end on April 16th, 2025.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.23, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}). If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
