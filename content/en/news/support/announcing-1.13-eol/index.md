According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#supported-releases/), minor releases like 1.13 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.15 in this case). [Istio 1.15 was released on August 31st](/news/releases/1.15.x/announcing-1.15/), and support for 1.13 will end on October 12th, 2022.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.13, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}). If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
