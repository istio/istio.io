As [previously announced](/news/support/announcing-1.0-eol/), support for Istio 1.0 has now officially ended.

We will no longer back-port fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.0, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}) if you haven't already.
