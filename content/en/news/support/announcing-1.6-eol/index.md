According to Istio's [support policy](/about/supported-releases#supported-releases/), LTS releases like 1.6 are supported for three months after the next LTS release. Since [1.7 was released on August 21st](/news/releases/1.7.x/announcing-1.7/), support for 1.6 will end on November 21st, 2020.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.6, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}).  If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
