As [previously announced](/news/support/announcing-1.6-eol/), support for Istio 1.6 has now officially ended.

Istio 1.6.14 will be released November 23rd. At this point we will no longer back-port fixes for security issues and
critical bugs to 1.6, so we heartily encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}})
if you haven't already.
