According to Istio's [support policy](/about/supported-releases#supported-releases/), LTS releases like 1.7 are supported for three months after the next LTS release. Since [1.8 was released on November 19th](/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/), support for 1.7 will end on February 19th, 2021.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.7, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}).  If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
