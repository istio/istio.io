According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#supported-releases/), minor releases like 1.14 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.16 in this case). [Istio 1.16 was released on November 15th](/news/releases/1.16.x/announcing-1.16/), and support for 1.14 will end on December 27th, 2022.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.14, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}). If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
