According to Istio's [extended support policy](/blog/2021/extended-support/), minor releases like 1.10 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.12 in this case). [Istio 1.12 was released on November 18th](/news/releases/1.12.x/announcing-1.12/), and support for 1.10 will end on December 30th, 2021.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.10, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}).  If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
