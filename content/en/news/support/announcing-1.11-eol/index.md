According to Istio's [support policy](/docs/releases/supported-releases#supported-releases/), minor releases like 1.11 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.13 in this case). [Istio 1.13 was released on February 11th](/news/releases/1.13.x/announcing-1.13/), and support for 1.11 will end on March 25th, 2022.

At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.11, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio ({{<istio_release_name>}}). If you don't do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.

We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.
