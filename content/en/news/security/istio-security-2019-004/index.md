Envoy, and subsequently Istio are vulnerable to a series of trivial HTTP/2-based DoS attacks:

* HTTP/2 flood using PING frames and queuing of response PING ACK frames that results in unbounded memory growth (which can lead to out of memory conditions).
* HTTP/2 flood using PRIORITY frames that results in excessive CPU usage and starvation of other clients.
* HTTP/2 flood using HEADERS frames with invalid HTTP headers and queuing of response `RST_STREAM` frames that results in unbounded memory growth (which can lead to out of memory conditions).
* HTTP/2 flood using SETTINGS frames and queuing of SETTINGS ACK frames that results in unbounded memory growth (which can lead to out of memory conditions).
* HTTP/2 flood using frames with an empty payload that results in excessive CPU usage and starvation of other clients.

Those vulnerabilities were reported externally and affect multiple proxy implementations.
See [this security bulletin](https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md) for more information.

## Impact and detection

If Istio terminates externally originated HTTP then it is vulnerable.   If Istio is instead fronted by an intermediary that terminates HTTP (e.g., a HTTP load balancer), then that intermediary would protect Istio, assuming the intermediary is not itself vulnerable to the same HTTP/2 exploits.

## Mitigation

* For Istio 1.1.x deployments: update to a [Istio 1.1.13](/news/releases/1.1.x/announcing-1.1.13) or later.
* For Istio 1.2.x deployments: update to a [Istio 1.2.4](/news/releases/1.2.x/announcing-1.2.4) or later.
