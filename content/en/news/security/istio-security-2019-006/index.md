Envoy, and subsequently Istio, are vulnerable to the following DoS attack.
An infinite loop can be triggered in Envoy if the option `continue_on_listener_filters_timeout` is set to `True`. This has been the case for Istio since the introduction of the Protocol Detection feature in Istio 1.3
A remote attacker may trivially trigger that vulnerability, effectively exhausting Envoyâ€™s CPU resources and causing a denial-of-service attack.

## Impact and detection

Both Istio gateways and sidecars are vulnerable to this issue. If you are running one of the affected releases, your cluster is vulnerable.

## Mitigation

* Workaround: The exploitation of that vulnerability can be prevented by customizing Istio installation (as described in [installation options](/docs/reference/config/installation-options/#pilot-options) ), using Helm to override the following options:

    {{< text plain >}}
    --set pilot.env.PILOT_INBOUND_PROTOCOL_DETECTION_TIMEOUT=0s --set global.proxy.protocolDetectionTimeout=0s
    {{< /text >}}

* For Istio 1.3.x deployments: update to [Istio 1.3.5](/news/releases/1.3.x/announcing-1.3.5) or later.
