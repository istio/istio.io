{{< security_bulletin >}}

This issue only affects Istio 1.9.0; previous versions of Istio are not affected. This issue has been given a CVSS score
of 8.2 by the Istio product security working group.

Envoy, and subsequently Istio, is vulnerable to a newly discovered vulnerability:

- [Envoy JWT filter bypass when using the allow_missing configuration under requires_any](https://groups.google.com/g/envoy-security-announce/c/Hp16L27L00Q).

You are subject to the vulnerability if you are using `RequestAuthentication` alone for JWT validation.

You are **not** subject to the vulnerability if you use **both** `RequestAuthentication` and `AuthorizationPolicy` for JWT validation.

{{< warning >}}
Please note that `RequestAuthentication` is used to define a list of issuers that should be accepted. It does not reject
a request without JWT token.
{{< /warning >}}

For Istio, this vulnerability only exists if your service:
* Accepts JWT tokens (with `RequestAuthentication`)
* Has some service paths without `AuthorizationPolicy` applied.

For the service paths that both conditions are met, an incoming request with a JWT token, and the token issuer is not in
`RequestAuthentication` will bypass the JWT validation, instead of getting rejected.

## Mitigation

For proper JWT validation, you should always use the `AuthorizationPolicy` as documented on istio.io for
[specifying a valid token](/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/#require-a-valid-token).
To do this you will have to audit all of your `RequestAuthentication` and subsequent `AuthorizationPolicy` resources to
make sure they align with the documented practice.
