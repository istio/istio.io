## Changes

- **Fixed** a bug where wildcard hosts were incorrectly added even when a `Sidecar` resource only specified particular hosts.  ([Issue #33387](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/33387))

- **Fixed** a bug where setting the `retryRemoteLocalities` on a `VirtualService` would produce configuration that Envoy would reject.  ([Issue #33737](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/33737))

- **Improved** the `meshConfig.defaultConfig.proxyMetadata` field to do a deep merge when overridden rather than replacing all values.
