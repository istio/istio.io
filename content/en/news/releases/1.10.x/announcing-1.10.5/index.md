  ([Issue #34837](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/34837))

- **Fixed** an issue causing `istioctl profile diff` and `istioctl profile dump` to output unexpected info logs.

  ([Issue #34653](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/34653))

- **Fixed** an issue causing the deployment analyzer to ignore service namespaces during the analysis process.

  ([Issue #34944](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/34944))

- **Fixed** an issue causing memory to not be freed after XDS clients disconnect.
