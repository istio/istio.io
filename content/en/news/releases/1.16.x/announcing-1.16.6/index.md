## Security update

- __[CVE-2023-35945](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-jfxv-29pc-x22r)__: (CVSS Score 7.5, High):
HTTP/2 memory leak in `nghttp2` codec.

## Changes

- **Added** support for `PodDisruptionBudget` (PDB) in the Gateway chart.
  ([Issue #44469](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/44469))

- **Fixed** an issue where the certificate validity was not accurate for `istioctl proxy-config secret` command.

- **Fixed** CPU usage was abnormally high when the certificate specified by DestinationRule is invalid.
  ([Issue #44986](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/44986))

- **Fixed** an issue where Istiod might crash when a cluster is deleted and xDS cache is disabled.
  ([Issue #45798](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/45798))

- **Fixed** an issue where specifying multiple include conditions using `--include` in a bug report didn't work as expected.
  ([Issue #45839](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/45839))

- **Fixed** an issue where disabling a log provider through Istio telemetry API would not work.

- **Fixed** an issue where `Telemetry` would not be fully disabled unless `match.metric=ALL_METRICS` was explicitly specified; matching all metrics is now correctly considered as the default.
