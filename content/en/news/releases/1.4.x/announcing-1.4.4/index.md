## Security update

- **ISTIO-SECURITY-2020-001** An improper input validation has been discovered in `AuthenticationPolicy`.

__[CVE-2020-8595](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8595)__: A bug in Istio's [Authentication Policy](https://archive.istio.io/1.4/docs/reference/config/security/istio.authentication.v1alpha1/#Policy) exact path matching logic allows unauthorized access to resources without a valid JWT token.

## Bug fixes

- **Fixed** Debian packaging of `iptables` scripts ([Issue 19615](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/19615)).
- **Fixed** an issue where Pilot generated a wrong Envoy configuration when the same port was used more than once ([Issue 19935](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/19935)).
- **Fixed** an issue where running multiple instances of Pilot could lead to a crash ([Issue 20047](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/20047)).
- **Fixed** a potential flood of configuration pushes from Pilot to Envoy when scaling the deployment to zero ([Issue 17957](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/17957)).
- **Fixed** an issue where Mixer could not fetch the correct information from the request/response when pod contains a dot in its name  ([Issue 20028](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/20028)).
- **Fixed** an issue where Pilot sometimes would not send a correct pod configuration to Envoy ([Issue 19025](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/19025)).
- **Fixed** an issue where sidecar injector with SDS enabled was overwriting pod `securityContext` section, instead of just patching it ([Issue 20409](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/20409)).

## Improvements

- **Improved** Better compatibility with Google CA. (Issues [20530](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/20530), [20560](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/20560)).
- **Improved** Added analyzer error message when Policies using JWT are not configured properly (Issues [20884](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/20884), [20767](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/20767)).
