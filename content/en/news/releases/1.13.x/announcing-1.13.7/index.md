This release contains a fix for [CVE-2022-31045](/news/security/istio-security-2022-005/#cve-2022-31045) and
bug fixes to improve robustness. We recommend users install this release instead of Istio 1.13.6,
which does not contain the above CVE fix.
This release note describes whatâ€™s different between Istio 1.13.6 and Istio 1.13.7.

FYI, [Go 1.18.4 has been released](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/nqrv9fbR0zE),
which includes 9 security fixes. We recommend you to upgrade to this newer Go version if you are using Go locally.
