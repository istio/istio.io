## Bug fixes

- Fix `redisquota` inconsistency in regards to `memquota` counting ([Issue 15543](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/15543)).
- Fix an Envoy crash introduced in Istio 1.2.5 ([Issue 16357](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/16357)).
- Fix Citadel health check broken in the context of plugin certs (with intermediate certs) ([Issue 16593](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/16593)).
