{{< warning >}}
Istio 1.14.2 does not contain a fix for [CVE-2022-31045](/news/security/istio-security-2022-005/#cve-2022-31045). We recommend users to not install Istio 1.14.2
and use Istio 1.14.1 for now. Istio 1.14.3 will be released later this week.
{{< /warning >}}

This release contains bug fixes to improve robustness and some additional support.
This release note describes whatâ€™s different between Istio 1.14.1 and Istio 1.14.2.

FYI, [Go 1.18.4 has been released](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/nqrv9fbR0zE),
which includes 9 security fixes. We recommend you to upgrade to this newer Go version if you are using Go locally.

  ([Issue #39454](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39454))

  ([Issue #38528](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/38528))

- **Fixed** a bug when updating a multi-cluster secret, the previous cluster is not stopped. Even deleting the secret will not stop the previous cluster.  ([Issue #39366](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39366))

- **Fixed** a bug where specifying `warmupDuration` without `Lb` policy is not configuring the warmup duration.  ([Issue #39430](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39430))

  ([Issue #39825](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39825))

- **Fixed** an issue where the `ProxyConfig` image type is not taking effect.
  ([Issue #38959](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/38959))
