This new feature adds a new approach for CA integration through the Envoy SDS API.

## Add the auto-sni support

Some servers require SNI be included in a request. This new feature configures SNI
automatically.

## Add the support of configuring the TLS version for Istio workloads

TLS version is important for security. This new feature adds
