## Changes

- **Added** support for pushing additional federated trust domains from `caCertificates` to the peer SAN validator. [Issue #41666](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/41666)

- **Fixed** an issue where `EnvoyFilter` for `Cluster.ConnectTimeout` was affecting unrelated `Clusters`. [Issue # 43435](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43435)
