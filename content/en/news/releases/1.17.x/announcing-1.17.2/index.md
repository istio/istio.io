## Changes

- **Added** support for pushing additional federated trust domains from `caCertificates` to the peer SAN validator.
  ([Issue #41666](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/41666))

- **Fixed** overwriting label `istio.io/rev` in injected gateways when `istio.io/rev=<tag>`.
  ([Issue #33237](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/33237))

- **Fixed** an issue where you could not disable tracing in `ProxyConfig`.
  ([Issue #31809](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/31809))

- **Fixed** admission webhook fails with custom header value format.
  ([Issue #42749](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/42749))

- **Fixed** a bug that would cause unexpected behavior when applying access logging configuration based on the direction of traffic. With this fix, access logging configuration for `CLIENT` or `SERVER` will not affect each other.
  ([Issue #43371](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43371))

- **Fixed** an issue where `EnvoyFilter` for `Cluster.ConnectTimeout` was affecting unrelated `Clusters`.
  ([Issue #43435](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43435))

- **Fixed** a bug in `istioctl analyze` where some messages are missed when there are services with no selector in the analyzed namespace.
  ([PR #43678](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/43678))

- **Fixed** resource namespace resolution for `istioctl` commands.
  ([Issue #43691](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43691))

  ([Issue #43858](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43858))

- **Fixed** an issue where RBAC updates were not sent to older proxies after upgrading istiod to 1.17.
  ([Issue #43785](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43785))

- **Fixed** reconciliation logic in the validation webhook controller to rate-limit the retries in the loop. This should drastically reduce churn (and generated logs) in cases of misconfiguration.
  ([Issue #32210](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/32210))

- **Fixed** an issue causing VMs using auto-registration to ignore labels other than those defined in a `WorkloadGroup`.
  ([PR #44012](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/44012))

- **Fixed** `istioctl experimental wait` has undecipherable message when `PILOT_ENABLE_CONFIG_DISTRIBUTION_TRACKING` is not enabled.
  ([Issue #42967](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/42967))
