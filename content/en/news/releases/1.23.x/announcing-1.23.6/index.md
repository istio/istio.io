{{< relnote >}}

## Changes

- **Fixed** an issue where customizing the workload identity SDS socketname via `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_SOCKET_FILE` did not work, due to envoy bootstrap not being updated.
  ([Issue #51979](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/51979))

- **Fixed** an issue where Istiod fails with LDS error for proxies <1.23 when meshConfig.accessLogEncoding is set to JSON.
  ([Issue #55116](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55116))

- **Fixed** an issue that `gateway` injection template didn't respect the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-logs-container`
and `kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container` annotations.

- **Fixed** the validation webhook rejecting an otherwise valid connectionPool.tcp.IdleTimeout=0s.
  ([Issue #55409](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55409))

- **Fixed** an issue that validation webhook incorrectly report a warning when a ServiceEntry configures `workloadSelector`` with DNS resolution.
  ([Issue #50164](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50164))

- **Fixed** an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient destinations.

- **Fixed** DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) is now affected by traffic annotations like `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges` and `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts`. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.
