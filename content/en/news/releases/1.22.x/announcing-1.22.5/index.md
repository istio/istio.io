## Changes

- **Fixed** `PILOT_SIDECAR_USE_REMOTE_ADDRESS` functionality on sidecars to support setting internal addresses to mesh network rather than localhost to prevent header sanitization if `envoy.reloadable_features.explicit_internal_address_config` is enabled.

- **Removed** a change in 1.22.4 to the handling of multiple service VIPs in ServiceEntry.
