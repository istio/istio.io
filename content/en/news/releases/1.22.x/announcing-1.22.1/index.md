## Changes

- **Added** a new, optional experimental admission policy that only allows stable features/fields to be used in Istio APIs when using a remote Istiod cluster.
  ([Issue #173](https://github.com/istio/enhancements/issues/173))

- **Fixed** adding of pod IPs to the host's `ipset` to explicitly fail instead of silently overwriting.

- **Fixed** an issue causing `outboundstatname` in MeshConfig to not be honored for subset clusters.

- **Fixed** custom injection of the `istio-proxy` container not working properly when `SecurityContext.RunAs` fields were set.

- **Fixed** returning 503 errors by auto-passthrough gateways created after enabling mTLS.

- **Fixed** `serviceRegistry` orders influence the proxy labels, so we put the Kubernetes registry in front.
