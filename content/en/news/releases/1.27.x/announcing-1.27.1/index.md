## Changes

- **Fixed** an issue where `istio-iptables` would sometimes ignore the IPv4 state in favor of the IPv6 state when deciding whether new iptables rules needed to be applied.
  ([Issue #56587](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56587))

- **Fixed** a bug where our tag watcher code didn't consider the default revision to be the same as the default tag. This would cause issues where Kubernetes gateways wouldn't be programmed.
  ([Issue #56767](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56767))

- **Fixed** an issue causing Gateway chart installation failures with Helm v3.18.5 due to a stricter JSON schema validator. The chart's schema has been updated to be compatible.
  ([Issue #57354](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57354))

- **Fixed** an issue where the `PreserveHeaderCase` option was overriding other HTTP/1.x protocol options, such as HTTP/1.0.
  ([Issue #57528](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57528))

- **Fixed** a change in output of `istioctl proxy-status` to be more consistent with previous versions.
  ([Issue #57339](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57339))

- **Fixed** iptables detection logic to fall back to `iptables-nft` when the `iptable_nat` module is missing.
  ([Issue #57380](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57380))

- **Fixed** a bug that incorrectly rejected traffic policies when only `retry_budget` was set.
