## Changes

- **Fixed** `PILOT_SIDECAR_USE_REMOTE_ADDRESS` functionality on sidecars to support setting internal addresses to mesh network rather than localhost to prevent header sanitization if `envoy.reloadable_features.explicit_internal_address_config` is enabled.

- **Fixed** `VirtualMachine` `WorkloadEntry` locality label missing during auto registration.
