## Changes

- **Fixed** a bug where overlapping wildcard hosts in a `VirtualService` produces incorrect routing configurations
  when wildcard services were selected (e.g. in `ServiceEntry`).
  ([Issue #45415](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/45415))

- **Fixed** an issue where `istioctl proxy-config ecds` didn't display all `EcdsConfigDump`.

- **Fixed** an issue where new endpoints may not be sent to proxies.
  ([Issue #48373](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/48373))

- **Fixed** an issue where installing with Stackdriver and using custom configurations would prevent Stackdriver from being
  enabled.

- **Fixed** an issue where long-lived connections, TCP bytes and gRPC, could result in a proxy memory leak.
