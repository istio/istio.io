## Security update

- __CVE-2023-35941__: (CVSS Score 8.6, High): OAuth2 credentials exploit with permanent validity.
- __CVE-2023-35942__: (CVSS Score 6.5, Moderate): gRPC access log crash caused by the listener draining.

## Changes

- **Added** support for a flag called `USE_EXTERNAL_WORKLOAD_SDS`. When set to true, it will require an external SDS workload socket and will prevent the istio-proxy from starting if the workload SDS socket is not found. ([Issue #45534](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/45534))
