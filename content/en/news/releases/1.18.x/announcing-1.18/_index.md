## What's new

### Ambient Mesh

Istio 1.18 marks the first release of ambient mesh, a new Istio data plane mode thatâ€™s designed for simplified operations, broader application compatibility, and reduced infrastructure cost. For more details see the [announcement blog](/blog/2022/introducing-ambient-mesh/).

**Note**: Ambient Mesh is currently in alpha and is not recommended for production use.

### Gateway API Support Improvements

Istio 1.18 improves support for the Kubernetes Gateway API, including support for extra v1beta1 resources and enhancements to automated deployment logic to no longer rely on pod injection.  Users of Gateway API on Istio should review this release's upgrade notes for important guidance on upgrading.

### Proxy Concurrency Changes

Previously, the proxy `concurrency` setting, which configures how many worker threads the proxy runs,
was inconsistently configured between sidecars and different gateway installation mechanisms.  In Istio 1.18, concurrency configuration has been tweaked to be consistent across deployment types.  More details on this change can be found in the upgrade notes for this release.

### Enhancements to the `istioctl` command

Added a number of enhancements to the istioctl command including enhancements to the bug reporting process and various improvements to the istioctl analyze command.
