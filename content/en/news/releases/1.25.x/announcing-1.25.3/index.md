## Security Updates

- [CVE-2025-46821](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46821) (CVSS Score 5.3, Medium): Bypass of RBAC `uri_template` permission.

If you use `**` within an `AuthorizationPolicy`'s path field, it is recommended you upgrade to Istio 1.25.3.

## Changes

- **Removed** the restriction where revision tag only worked when `istiodRemote` was not enabled in the istiod helm chart. Revision tags now work as long as the `revisionTags` is specified without regard to whether `istiodRemote` is enabled or not.
