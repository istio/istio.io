## Whatâ€™s new?

### Ambient mode enhancements

- DNS proxying enabled by default for Ambient pods, allowing ServiceEntries and egress gateway routing to work by default.
- Default-deny policy for waypoints via GatewayClass `targetRef`.
- Ability to enforce L4 policy against the waypoint proxy instance itself.
- Support for per-pod traffic customization around virtual interfaces and DNS capture
- `istio-cni` DaemonSet can now be safely upgraded in-place in an active cluster, without requiring a node cordon to prevent pods spawned during the upgrade process from escaping ambient traffic capture.

### Zonal routing enhancements

Whether for reliability, performance, or cost reasons, controlling cross-zone and cross-region traffic is often an important day-2 operation for users.
With Istio 1.25, this just gets even easier!

The Kubernetes [Traffic distribution](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#traffic-distribution) feature is now fully supported, offering a simplified interface to keep traffic local. The existing Istio [locality load balancing](https://github.com/docs/tasks/traffic-management/locality-load-balancing/) remains for more complex use cases. Ztunnel will now report the additional `source_zone`, `source_region`, `destination_zone`, and `destination_region` labels to all metrics, giving a clear view of cross-zonal traffic.

### DNS auto-allocation improvements

DNS proxying is now enabled by default for ambient workloads.
This enhances performance and security, as well as enabling [egress traffic controls](https://ambientmesh.io/docs/traffic/mesh-egress/#egress-gateways).
Along with this change comes a few advanced per-pod customization around traffic captured, including during off DNS capture for specific workloads if necessary; Check out the change notes for more information.
