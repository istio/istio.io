## Bug fixes and minor enhancements

- Configure Prometheus to monitor Citadel ([Issue 12175](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/12175))
- Improve output of [`istioctl verify-install`](/docs/reference/commands/istioctl/#istioctl-verify-install) command ([Issue 12174](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/12174))
- Reduce log level for missing service account messages for a SPIFFE URI ([Issue 12108](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/12108))
- Fix broken path on the opt-in SDS feature's Unix domain socket ([Issue 12688](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/12688))
- Fix Envoy tracing that was preventing a child span from being created if the parent span was propagated with an empty string ([Envoy Issue 6263](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/6263))
- Add namespace scoping to the Gateway 'port' names.  This fixes two issues:
    - `IngressGateway` only respects first port 443 Gateway definition ([Issue 11509](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/11509))
    - Istio `IngressGateway` routing broken with two different gateways with same port name (SDS) ([Issue 12500](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/12500))
- Five bug fixes for locality weighted load balancing:
    - Fix bug causing empty endpoints per locality ([Issue 12610](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/12610))
    - Apply locality weighted load balancing configuration correctly ([Issue 12587](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/12587))
    - Locality label `istio-locality` in Kubernetes should not contain `/`, use `.` ([Issue 12582](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/12582))
    - Fix crash in locality load balancing ([Issue 12649](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/12649))
    - Fix bug in locality load balancing normalization ([Issue 12579](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/12579))
- Propagate Envoy Metrics Service configuration ([Issue 12569](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/12569))
- Do not apply `VirtualService` rule to the wrong gateway ([Issue 10313](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/10313))
