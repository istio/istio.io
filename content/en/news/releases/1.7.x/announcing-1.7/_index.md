We are pleased to announce the release of Istio 1.7!

{{< relnote >}}

With this release, we continue the path we charted earlier this year in
our [roadmap post](/blog/2020/tradewinds-2020/), sailing toward more
simplicity, a better installation experience, and we have added other goodies as
well.

Here’s some of what’s coming to you in today's release:

## Item 1

## Item 2

## Item 3

## Join the Istio community
