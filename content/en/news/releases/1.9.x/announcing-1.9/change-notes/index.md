## Known Issues

- Wasm extension configuration updates can be disruptive (see [Issue #29843](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/29843)).

## Traffic Management

- **Added** Add [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) endpoint to pilot-agent.
  ([Issue #28040](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/28040))

- **Added** Allow enabling gRPC logging with --log_output_level for pilot.
  ([Issue #28482](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/28482))

- **Added** a new experimental proxy option [DNS_AUTO_ALLOCATE](/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/dns-proxy), to control auto allocation of ServiceEntry addresses. Previously,
this option was tied to `DNS_CAPTURE`. Now, `DNS_CAPTURE` can be enabled without auto allocation. See [Smart DNS Proxying](/blog/2020/dns-proxy/) for more info.
  ([Issue #29324](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/29324))

- **Fixed** istiod will no longer generate listeners for privileged gateway ports (<1024) if the gateway Pod does not have sufficient permissions.
  ([Issue #27566](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/27566))

- **Fixed** an issue that caused very high memory usage with a large number of `ServiceEntries`.
  ([Issue #25531](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/25531))

- **Removed** support for reading Istio configuration over the Mesh Configuration Protocol (MCP). ([Pull Request #28634](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/28634))

## Security

- **Added** option to allow users to enable token exchange for their XDS flows, which exchanges a k8s token for a token that can be authenticated by their XDS servers.
  ([Issue #29943](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/29943))

- **Added** OIDC JWT authenticator that supports both JWKS-URI and OIDC discovery. The OIDC JWT authenticator will be used when configured through the JWT_RULE env variable.  ([Issue #30295](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/30295))

- **Added** support of PeerAuthentication per-port-level configuration on pass through filter chains.
  ([Issue #27994](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/27994))

- **Added** an experimental [`CUSTOM` action](/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/#AuthorizationPolicy-Action)
  in AuthorizationPolicy for integration with external authorization systems like OPA, OAuth2 and more. See [the blog on this feature](/blog/2021/better-external-authz/)
  for more info. ([Issue #27790](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/27790))

## Telemetry

  ([Issue #28597](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/28597))

- **Updated** Prometheus metrics to include `source_cluster` and `destination_cluster` labels by default for all scenarios. Previously, this was only enabled for multi-cluster scenarios. ([Pull Request #30036](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/30036))

- **Updated** default access log to include `RESPONSE_CODE_DETAILS` and `CONNECTION_TERMINATION_DETAILS` for proxy version >= 1.9. ([Pull Request #27903](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/27903))

## Extensibility

- **Added** [Reliable Wasm module remote load](/docs/ops/configuration/extensibility/wasm-module-distribution) with Istio agent. ([Issue #29989](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/29989))

## Networking

- **Added** Correctly iptables rules and listener filters setting to support original src ip preserve in TPROXY mode within a cluster.  ([Issue #23369](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/23369))

- **Fixed** a bug where locality weights are only applied when outlier detection is enabled. ([Issue #28942](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/28942))

## Installation

- **Added** post-install/in-place upgrade verification of control plane health. Use `--verify` flag with `istioctl install` or `istioctl upgrade`. ([Issue #21715](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/21715))

- **Added** Add [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) endpoint to pilot-agent. ([Issue #28040](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/28040))

- **Added** Istio 1.9 supports Kubernetes versions 1.17 to 1.20.
  ([Issue #30176](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/30176))

- **Added** support for applications that bind to their pod IP address, rather than wildcard or localhost address, through the `Sidecar` API. ([Pull Request #28178](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/28178))

  ([Issue #30203](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/30203))

- **Improved** the sidecar injector to better utilize pod labels to determine if injection is required. This is not enabled
by default in this release, but can be tested using `--set values.sidecarInjectorWebhook.useLegacySelectors=false`. ([Pull Request #30013](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/30013))

enabled by setting the `PILOT_ENABLE_CROSS_CLUSTER_WORKLOAD_ENTRY` environment variable in istiod.
  ([Issue #29026](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/29026))

- **Added** `istioctl analyze` now informs if deprecated or alpha-level annotations are present.
(These checks can be disabled using `--suppress "IST0135=*"` and `--suppress "IST0136=*"`
respectively.)
  ([Issue #29154](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/29154))

failover and weighted distribution. In addition, the new docs are now
automatically verified for correctness. ([Pull Request #29651](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/29651))
