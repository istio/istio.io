Istio 1.26.0 is officially supported on Kubernetes versions 1.29 to 1.32. We expect 1.33 to work also, and plan to add testing and support before Istio 1.26.1.

## A note on `EnvoyFilter` support in ambient mode

`EnvoyFilter` is Istio's break-glass API for advanced configuration of Envoy proxies. Please note that *`EnvoyFilter` is not currently supported for any existing Istio version with waypoint proxies*. While it may be possible to use `EnvoyFilter` with waypoints in limited scenarios, its use is not supported, and is actively discouraged by the maintainers. The alpha API may break in future releases as it evolves. We expect official support will be provided at a later date.

## Whatâ€™s new?

### Customization of resources provisioned by the Gateway API

When you create a Gateway or a waypoint using the Gateway API, a `Service` and a `Deployment` are created automatically. It has been a common request to allow customization of these objects, and that is now supported in Istio 1.26 by specifying a `ConfigMap` of parameters. If configuration for a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` or `PodDisruptionBudget` is provided, those resources will automatically be created also. [Learn more about customizing the generated Gateway API resources.](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment)

### New Gateway API support

[`TCPRoute`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tcp/) is now available in waypoints, allowing TCP traffic shifting in ambient mode.

We also added support for the experimental [`BackendTLSPolicy`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtlspolicy/) and started the implementation of [`BackendTrafficPolicy`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtrafficpolicy/) in Gateway API 1.3, which will eventually set retry constraints.

### Support for the new Kubernetes `ClusterTrustBundle`

We've added experimental support for [the experimental `ClusterTrustBundle` resource in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#cluster-trust-bundles), allowing support for the new method of bundling a certificate and its root of trust into a single object.

### Plus much, much more

* `istioctl analyze` can now run specific checks!
* The CNI node agent no longer runs in the `hostNetwork` namespace by default, reducing the chance of port conflicts with other services running on a host!
* Required `ResourceQuota` resources and `cniBinDir` values are set automatically when installing on GKE!
* An `EnvoyFilter` can now match a `VirtualHost` on a domain name!

## Catch up with the Istio project

If you only check in with us when we have a new release, you might have missed that [we published a security audit on ztunnel](/blog/2025/ztunnel-security-assessment/), [we compared performance of ambient mode throughput vs. running in-kernel](/blog/2025/ambient-performance/), or that [we had a major presence at KubeCon EU](/blog/2025/istio-at-kubecon-eu/). Check those posts out!
