To provide clarity to our users, use the standard terms in this section
consistently within the documentation.

## Service

Avoid using the term **service**. Research shows that different folks understand
different things under that term. The following table shows acceptable
alternatives that provide greater specificity and clarity to readers:

|Do                                          | Don't
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
| Workload A sends a request to Workload B.  | Service A sends a request to Service B.
| New workload instances start when ...      | New service instances start when ...
| The application consists of two workloads. | The service consists of two services.

Our glossary establishes the agreed-upon terminology, and provides definitions to
avoid confusion.

## Envoy

We prefer to use "Envoy” as it’s a more concrete term than "proxy" and
resonates if used consistently throughout the docs.

Synonyms:

- "Envoy sidecar” - ok
- "Envoy proxy” - ok
- "The Istio proxy” -- best to avoid unless you’re talking about advanced
  scenarios where another proxy might be used.
- "Sidecar”  -- mostly restricted to conceptual docs
- "Proxy" -- only if context is obvious

Related Terms:

- Proxy agent  - This is a minor infrastructural component and should only show
  up in low-level detail documentation. It is not a proper noun.
