title: How do I migrate existing Mixer functionality?

Mixer was [removed in the 1.8 Istio release](/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/#deprecations).
Migration is needed if you still rely on Mixer's built-in adapters or any out-of-process adapters for mesh extension.

For built-in adapters, several alternatives are provided:

* `Prometheus` and `Stackdriver` integrations are implemented as [proxy extensions](/docs/reference/config/proxy_extensions/).
    Customization of telemetry generated by these two extensions can be achieved via [request classification](/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/classify-metrics/) and [Prometheus metrics customization](/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/customize-metrics/).
* Global and Local Rate-Limiting (`memquota` and `redisquota` adapters) functionality is provided through the [Envoy-based rate-limiting solution](/docs/tasks/policy-enforcement/rate-limit/).
* `OPA` adapter is replaced by the [Envoy ext-authz based solution](/docs/tasks/security/authorization/authz-custom/), which supports [integration with OPA policy agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-introduction/).

For custom out-of-process adapters, migration to Wasm-based extensions is strongly encouraged. Please refer to the guides on [Wasm module development](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/wasm-extensions/blob/master/doc/write-a-wasm-extension-with-cpp.md) and [extension distribution](/docs/tasks/extensibility/wasm-module-distribution/). As a temporary solution, you can [enable Envoy ext-authz and gRPC access log API support in Mixer](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Enabling-Envoy-Authorization-Service-and-gRPC-Access-Log-Service-With-Mixer), which allows you to upgrade Istio to post 1.7 versions while still using 1.7 Mixer with out-of-process adapters. This will give you more time to migrate to Wasm-based extensions. Note this temporary solution is not battle-tested and will unlikely get patch fixes, since it is only available on the Istio 1.7 branch which is out of support window after Feb 2021.
