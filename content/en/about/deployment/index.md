## Step one

Istio addresses the challenges developers and operators face as monolithic applications transition towards a distributed microservice architecture. To see how, it helps to take a more detailed look at Istioâ€™s service mesh. Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit.

## Step two

While the easy transition to mTLS for all microservices was a strong incentive, Istio also has the backing of many large organizations. Auto Trader UK was already working with Google, so knowing that Google was a strong backer of Istio gave them confidence it would be supported and grow long term.

Early success with experiments on GKE with Istio led to quick buy-in from the business. Capabilities that they had been trying to implement for months were suddenly ready in just a week. Istio was able to not only provide mTLS, but also robust retry and backup policies and outlier detection.

## Step three

Istio gave Auto Trader UK the confidence to deploy all applications to the public cloud. With increased observability, they now had a new way to both manage and think about infrastructure. They suddenly had insights into performance and security, meanwhile Istio was helping them discover existing bugs that had been there all along, unnoticed.
