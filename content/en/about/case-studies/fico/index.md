FICO started its mesh journey in 2019, picking up Istio at 0.8. Istio has matured a lot in that time, and the organization’s deployment and usage of Istio has matured significantly too. In [this presentation from IstioCon 2021](https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2021/sessions/fico-istio-journey/), Jeet Kaul, a VP of Engineering at FICO, walked through FICO’s journey with Istio from 2019 to today, discussing why they chose Istio initially, some of the growing pains they experienced, and what business goals they’ve been able to achieve because of Istio.
