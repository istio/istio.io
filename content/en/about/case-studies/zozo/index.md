ZOZOTOWN was launched in Dec 2004 and is currently one of the biggest fashion E-commerce companies in Japan. It was implemented as monoliths, and over the last 3 years a modernization project achieved gradual migration to a Kubernetes-based microservice architecture. ZOZO adopted Istio as a key enabler for the new ZOZOTOWN platform

In [this talk from IstioCon 2022](https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2022/sessions/accelerating-zozotown-modernization/), Yoichi Kawasaki discusses ZOZOâ€™s gradual migration strategy, how they integrated Istio into a platform with an existing in-house API Gateway, their zero-downtime migration, and how further Istio usage is planned to achieve a more sophisticated DevOps experience.
