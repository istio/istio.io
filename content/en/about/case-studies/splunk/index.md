Splunk has been a heavy Istio user for the last 3 years, using it as their baseline for network ingress, policy and authentication.

In [this talk from IstioCon 2022](https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2022/sessions/istio-at-splunk/), Bernard van de Walle explores how Splunk manages, installs and operationalizes Istio at scale on more than 40 clusters across multiple regions and providers. He describes their journey in detail, including the trade-offs that were taken into account before jumping into Istio, as well as the lessons learned over time. He also goes into detail on how Splunk's internal users are using Istio and how they are supported.
