This is a story of struggle, tradeoffs, and triumphs. Istio, as you may know, is a mission-critical piece of software for securing and connecting microservices across platforms. However, it can be daunting to introduce, operationalize, or adopt it successfully.

In [this talk from IstioCon 2021](https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2021/sessions/adopting-istio-across-100-clusters-at-t-mobile/), Joe Searcy digs into T-Mobileâ€™s journey of adopting Istio across 100+ clusters to support microservices for fraud detection, billing, sales, and APIs across many teams.
