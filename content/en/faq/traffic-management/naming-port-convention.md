Currently, Istio supports TCP based protocols. In additional to this, Istio provides additional functionality, such as routing and metrics, from other protocols such as `http` and `mysql`. Currently, UDP traffic is not supported.

For a list of all protocols, and information on how to configure protocols, view the [Protocol Selection](/docs/ops/traffic-management/protocol-selection/) documentation.
