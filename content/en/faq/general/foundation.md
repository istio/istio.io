No, Istio is an open source project under the [Apache License 2.0]({{< github_blob >}}/LICENSE) that exercises an
[open governance model](https://github.com/istio/community) with a multi-company [steering committee](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/STEERING-COMMITTEE.md),
[technical oversight committee](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) and distributed [working groups](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/WORKING-GROUPS.md).
There are no plans to donate Istio to a foundation at this time.
