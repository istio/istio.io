title: How do I get started using Istio?
weight: 30
---

We recommend following the instructions on the [getting started page](/docs/setup/getting-started/),
which installs a demonstration configuration along with Istio's premier sample application,
[Bookinfo](/docs/examples/bookinfo/).
You can then use this setup to [walk through various Istio guides](/docs/setup/getting-started/#next-steps)
that showcase intelligent routing, policy enforcement, security, telemetry, etc., in a tutorial style.

To start using Istio with production Kubernetes deployments, please refer to our
[deployment models](/docs/ops/deployment/deployment-models/) documentation and the
[which Istio installation method should I use?](/faq/setup/#install-method-selection)
FAQ page.
