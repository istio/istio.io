Basic documentation describing what the feature does, how to enable it, the restrictions and caveats, and a pointer to the issue or design doc the feature is based on.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Complete feature documentation published to istio.io In addition to the basic alpha-level documentation, beta documentation includes samples, tutorials, glossary entries, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Same as Beta.                                                                                                                               |
| Upgradeability        | The schema and semantics of an experimental feature may change in newer versions without any guarantees of preserving backwards compatibility requiring configuration changes during upgrades. API versions may increment faster than the release cadence and developers are not required to maintain multiple versions for backwards compatibility. Developers are encouraged to increment the API version when schema or semantics change in an incompatible way.        | The schema and semantics of an alpha feature may change in a later software release, without any provision for preserving configuration objects in an existing Istio installation API versions may increment faster than the release cadence and the developer need not maintain multiple versions Developers should increment the API version when schema or semantics change in an incompatible way.                                             | The schema and semantics may change in a later software release When this happens, an upgrade path will be documented In some cases, objects will be automatically converted to the new version In other cases, a manual upgrade may be necessary A manual upgrade may require downtime for anything relying on the new feature, and may require manual conversion of objects to the new version When manual conversion is necessary, the project will provide documentation on the process. | Only strictly compatible changes are allowed in subsequent software releases.                                                               |
| Testing               | The presence of the feature must not affect any released features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The feature is covered by unit tests and integration tests where the feature is enabled and the tests are non-flaky. Tests may not cover all corner cases, but the most common cases have been covered. Testing code coverage >= 70%. When the feature is disabled it does not regress performance of the system.                                                                                                                                  | Integration tests cover edge cases as well as common use cases. Integration tests cover all issues reported on the feature. The feature has end-to-end tests covering the samples/tutorials for the feature. Test code coverage is >= 80%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Superset of Beta, including tests for any issues discovered during Beta.

| Reliability           | The user should not expect the feature to be reliable may be untested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Because the feature is relatively new, and may lack complete end-to-end tests, enabling the feature via a flag might expose bugs which destabilize Istio (e.g. a bug in a control loop might rapidly create excessive numbers of objects, exhausting API storage).                                                                                                                                                                                 | Because the feature has e2e tests, enabling the feature should not create new bugs in unrelated features. Because the feature is relatively new, it may have minor bugs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | High. The feature is well tested and stable and reliable for all uses.                                                                      |
| Support               | There is no commitment from the Istio community to improve, maintain or complete the feature and the feature may be dropped entirely in a newer release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | There is no commitment from Istio to complete the feature The feature may be dropped entirely in a later software release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Istio commits to complete the feature, in some form, in a subsequent Stable version Typically this will happen within 3 months, but sometimes longer Releases should simultaneously support two consecutive versions (e.g. v1alpha1 and v1beta1; or v1beta1 and v1) for at least one supported release cycle (typically 3 months) so that users have enough time to upgrade and migrate resources.                                                                                           | The feature will continue to be present for many subsequent releases.                                                                       |
| Recommended Use Cases | In short-lived development or testing environments, geared towards soliciting early feedback from users to shape development efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | In short-lived development or testing environments, due to complexity of upgradeability and lack of long-term support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | In development or testing environments.
