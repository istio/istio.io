## Security Update

- **ISTIO-SECURITY-2020-004** Istio uses a hard coded `signing_key` for Kiali.

__[CVE-2020-1764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1764)__: Istio uses a default `signing key` to install Kiali. This can allow an attacker with access to Kiali to bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges over Istio.
In addition, another CVE is fixed in this release, described in the Kiali 1.15.1 [release](https://kiali.io/news/security-bulletins/kiali-security-001/).

## Changes

- **Fixed** an issue causing protocol detection to break HTTP2 traffic to gateways ([Issue 21230](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/21230)).
