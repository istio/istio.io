{{< relnote >}}

## Changes

- **Fixed** an issue where the Istio operator prunes all resources created by the operator, including itself. Now the operator will only remove resources belonging to the custom resource. ([Issue #30833](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/30833))

- **Fixed** an issue ensuring lease duration is always greater than the user configured `RENEW_DEADLINE` for Istio operator manager. ([Issue #27509](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/27509))

- **Fixed** an issue where a certificate provisioned by sidecar proxy cannot be used by Prometheus. ([Issue #29919](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/29919))

- **Fixed** an issue that creates an IOP under `istio-system` when installing Istio in another namespace. ([Issue #31517](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/31517))

- **Fixed** an issue when using `PeerAuthentication` to turn off mTLS while using multi-network. Now non-mTLS endpoints will be removed from cross-network load-balancing endpoints to prevent 500 errors. ([Issue #28798](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/28798))

- **Fixed** `istiod` never becoming ready when it fails to read resources from clusters configured via remote secrets.
After a timeout configured by `PILOT_REMOTE_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT` (default `30s`), `istiod` will become ready without
syncing remote clusters. The stat `remote_cluster_sync_timeouts` will be incremented when this occurs. ([Issue #30838](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/30838))

- **Fixed** an issue where `istiod` will not create a self-signed root CA and `istio-ca-root-cert` configmap when `values.global.pilotCertProvider` is `kubernetes`. ([Issue #32023](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/32023))

- **Improved** the `istioctl x workload` command to configure VMs to disable inbound `iptables` capture for admin ports, matching the behavior of Kubernetes Pods. ([Issue #29412](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/29412))

- **Improved** performance of `istiod` when running on clusters with thousands of namespaces. ([Issue #32269](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/32269)

- **Improved** detection of Server Side Apply in Kubernetes. ([Issue #32101](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/32101))
