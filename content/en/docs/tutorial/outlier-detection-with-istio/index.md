title: Outlier detection with Istio
overview: Mitigate faults related to intermittent failures by Istio.

weight: 130

---

In the case a microservice starts to fail multiple times, it is beneficial to stop sending
requests to the failing microservice for some period of time, since it will probably fail to handle them anyway.
You do not want to flood the failing microservice with requests since it will not be able to handle them.
You want to give the faulty microservice time to recuperate, and then to start sending the requests to it again.

1.  Deploy the version of `ratings` that becomes unavailable for 60 seconds from time to time, and define outlier
    detection for it.

1.  Check your Kiali console,
    [http://my-kiali.io/kiali/console](http://my-kiali.io/kiali/console), the graph of your namespace.

    {{< tip >}}
    Switch the fetching interval to `10s`, so you will see what happens more precisely.
    {{< /tip >}}

    Notice the two versions of `ratings`, _v1_ and _v-unavailable_, handling the requests successfully.

1.  Wait for about a minute. You will notice that _v-unavailable_ starts returning errors. It's box turns red, the
    box of the whole `ratings` microservice turns red, the box of `reviews` becomes orange.

        >}}

1.  Wait for about half minute for Istio to detect the failing version. (For the sake of the tutorial the outlier
    detection interval was set to 30 seconds, in real life you would use much smaller interval). Once Istio detects
    that _ratings v-unavailable_ starts to consecutively return errors, it will stop directing traffic to it. You will
    see that the incoming edge into _ratings v-unavailable_ will become gray and all the traffic will flow to
    _ratings v1_.

    {{< image width="80%"
        link="kiali-ratings-unavailable-detected.png"
        caption="Kiali Graph Tab with traffic not routed to ratings v-unavailable"
        >}}

1.  After about another half minute, Istio will start sending traffic to _ratings v-unavailable_ again.
    _ratings v-unavailable_ will return successful results for about a minute. After that, it will start failing again,
    and after some time Istio will detect it and will stop sending traffic to _ratings v-unavailable_. You may want to
    observe the process for several cycles.

1.  Remove the _unavailable_ version of `ratings` and recreate the destination rule and the virtual service to route to
    _ratings v1_:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f {{< github_file >}}/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml
    $ kubectl delete deployment ratings-v-unavailable
    {{< /text >}}
