Logs and monitoring are a very important aspect of microservices architecture. It is so important that it is considered one of the three prerequisites for transition to the microservices architecture style. No monitoring - no transition. (The other two requirements are _rapid provisioning_ and _rapid deployment_, according to [this article](https://aadrake.com/posts/2017-05-20-enough-with-the-microservices.html)).

With Istio, you gain monitoring and logging of the traffic between microservices out of the box.
You saw the Istio Dashboard already, you can use it for monitoring your microservices in real time.
In this module you will see how you can inspect and query logs related to the traffic between your microservices.

1.  Store the name of your namespace in the `NAMESPACE` environment variable.
    You will need it to recognize your microservices in the logs:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ export NAMESPACE=$(kubectl config view -o jsonpath="{.contexts[?(@.name == \"$(kubectl config current-context)\")].context.namespace}")
    $ echo $NAMESPACE
    tutorial
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Print Mixer access log entries, related to your namespace:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl -n istio-system logs -l istio-mixer-type=telemetry -c mixer | grep '"instance":"accesslog.instance.istio-system"' | grep "\"destinationNamespace\":\"$NAMESPACE\"" | grep '"reporter":"destination"'
    ...

    Notice the `sourceName` and `destinationName` attributes that tell you who called whom, for example `productpage`
    called `reviews`. (For `productpage`, `sourceName` is a pod of `istio-ingressgateway`).
    Notice the HTTP-related attributes: `responseCode`, `url`, `method`.
    Also observe general communication attributes: `responseSize`, `responseTimestamp`, `latency`.

    Note that the log entries from all of Bookinfo microservices appear in one place.
    You do not have to go after each and every microservice and to display their logs one by one.

While you can dump the log in the textual format and search for the relevant entries, you can do something smarter.
Instead of working with logs as text, use a log database, where you can query your logs, similar to querying
structured data in SQL databases. Querying a database is more efficient than searching text, so you can run
sophisticated queries to quickly get precise results. You can also let the database process the results, for example
to aggregate some metrics.

Istio is integrated out-of-the-box with
[Prometheus time series database and monitoring system](https://prometheus.io). Prometheus collects various
traffic-related metrics and provides
[a rich query language](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) for them.

See below several examples of Prometheus Istio-related queries.

1.  Access Prometheus UI at [http://my-istio-logs-database.io](http://my-istio-logs-database.io).
(The `my-istio-logs-database.io` URL should be in your /etc/hosts file, you set it
[previously](/docs/tutorial/run-bookinfo-with-kubernetes/#update-your-etc-hosts-file)).

{{< image width="80%"
    link="prometheus.png"
    caption="Prometheus Query UI"
    >}}

1.  Run the following example queries in the _Expression_ input box. Push the _Execute_ button to see query results in
the _Console_ tab. The queries use `tutorial` as the name of the application's namespace, substitute it with the name of
your namespace.

    1.  Get all the requests in your namespace:

    {{< text plain >}}
    istio_requests_total{destination_service_namespace="tutorial", reporter="destination"}
    {{< /text >}}

    1.  Get the sum of all the requests in your namespace:

    {{< text plain >}}
    sum(istio_requests_total{destination_service_namespace="tutorial", reporter="destination"})
    {{< /text >}}

    1.  Get the requests to `reviews` microservice:

    {{< text plain >}}
    istio_requests_total{destination_service_namespace="tutorial", reporter="destination",destination_service_name="reviews"}
    {{< /text >}}

    1.  [Rate](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#rate) of requests over the past 5 minutes to all instances of the `reviews` microservice:

    {{< text plain >}}
    rate(istio_requests_total{destination_service_namespace="tutorial", reporter="destination",destination_service_name="reviews"}[5m])
    {{< /text >}}

The queries above use the `istio_requests_total` metric, which is a standard Istio metric. You can observe
other metrics, in particular, the ones of Envoy ([Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) is the sidecar proxy of Istio). You
can see the collected metrics in the _insert metric at cursor_ drop-down menu.

You can even [define your own metrics](/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/collecting-metrics/).
