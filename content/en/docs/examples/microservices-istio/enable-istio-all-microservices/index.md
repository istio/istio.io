Previously, you enabled Istio on a single microservice, `productpage`. You can
proceed to enable Istio on the microservices incrementally to get the Istio
functionality for more microservices. For the purpose of this tutorial, you will
enable Istio on all the remaining microservices in one step.

1.  For the purpose of this tutorial, scale the deployments of the microservices
    down to 1:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl scale deployments --all --replicas 1
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Redeploy the Bookinfo application, Istio-enabled. The service `productpage` will not be
    redeployed since it already has Istio injected, and its pods will not be
    changed. This time you will use only a single replica of a microservice.

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ curl -s {{< github_file >}}/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml | istioctl kube-inject -f - | kubectl apply -l app!=reviews -f -
    $ curl -s {{< github_file >}}/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml | istioctl kube-inject -f - | kubectl apply -l app=reviews,version=v2 -f -
    service "details" unchanged
    deployment "details-v1" configured
    service "ratings" unchanged
    deployment "ratings-v1" configured
    service "productpage" unchanged
    deployment "productpage-v1" configured
    deployment "reviews-v2" configured
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Access the application's webpage several times. Note that Istio was added
    **transparently**, the original application did not change. It was added on
    the fly, without the need to undeploy and redeploy the whole application.

1.  Check the application pods and verify that now each pod has two containers.
    One container is the microservice itself, the other is the sidecar proxy
    attached to it:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl get pods
    details-v1-58c68b9ff-kz9lf        2/2       Running   0          2m
    productpage-v1-59b4f9f8d5-d4prx   2/2       Running   0          2m
    ratings-v1-b7b7fbbc9-sggxf        2/2       Running   0          2m
    reviews-v2-dfbcf859c-27dvk        2/2       Running   0          2m
    sleep-88ddbcfdd-cc85s             1/1       Running   0          7h
    {{< /text >}}

1.  Access the Istio dashboard using the custom URL you set in your `/etc/hosts` file
    [previously](/docs/examples/microservices-istio/bookinfo-kubernetes/#update-your-etc-hosts-configuration-file):

    {{< text plain >}}
    http://my-istio-dashboard.io/dashboard/db/istio-mesh-dashboard
    {{< /text >}}

1.  In the top left drop-down menu, select _Istio Mesh Dashboard_. Note that now all the services from your namespace
    appear in the list of services.

    {{< image width="80%"
        link="dashboard-mesh-all.png"
        caption="Istio Mesh Dashboard"
        >}}

1.  Check some other microservice in _Istio Service Dashboard_, e.g. `ratings` :

    {{< image width="80%"
        link="dashboard-ratings.png"
        caption="Istio Service Dashboard"
        >}}

1.  Visualize your application's topology by using the
    [Kiali](https://www.kiali.io) console, which is not a part of Istio, but is
    installed as part of the `demo` configuration.
    Access the dashboard using the custom URL you set in your `/etc/hosts` file
    [previously](/docs/examples/microservices-istio/bookinfo-kubernetes/#update-your-etc-hosts-configuration-file):

    {{< text plain >}}
    http://my-kiali.io/kiali/console
    {{< /text >}}

    If you installed Kiali as part of the [getting started](/docs/setup/getting-started/) instructions, your Kiali console user name is `admin` and the password is `admin`.

1.  Click on the Graph tab and select your namespace in the _Namespace_ drop-down menu in the top level corner.
    In the _Display_ drop-down menu mark the _Traffic Animation_ check box to see some cool traffic animation.

    {{< image width="80%"
        link="kiali-display-menu.png"
        caption="Kiali Graph Tab, display drop-down menu"
        >}}

1.  Try different options in the _Edge Labels_ drop-down menu. Hover with the mouse over the nodes and edges of the
    graph. Notice the traffic metrics on the right.

    {{< image width="80%"
        link="kiali-edge-labels-menu.png"
        caption="Kiali Graph Tab, edge labels drop-down menu"
        >}}

    {{< image width="80%"
        link="kiali-initial.png"
        caption="Kiali Graph Tab"
        >}}

You are ready to
[configure the Istio Ingress Gateway](/docs/examples/microservices-istio/istio-ingress-gateway).
