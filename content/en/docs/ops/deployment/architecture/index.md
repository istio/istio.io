An Istio service mesh is logically split into a **data plane** and a **control
plane**.

* The **data plane** is composed of a set of intelligent proxies
  ([Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/)) deployed as sidecars. These proxies
  mediate and control all network communication between microservices. They
  also collect and report telemetry on all mesh traffic.

* The **control plane** manages and configures the proxies to route traffic.

The following diagram shows the different components that make up each plane:

## Components

The following sections provide a brief overview of each of Istio's core components.

### Envoy

Istio uses an extended version of the
[Envoy](https://envoyproxy.github.io/envoy/) proxy. Envoy is a high-performance
proxy developed in C++ to mediate all inbound and outbound traffic for all
services in the service mesh.
Envoy proxies are the only Istio components that interact with data plane
traffic.

Envoy proxies are deployed as sidecars to services, logically
augmenting the services with Envoyâ€™s many built-in features,
for example:

* Dynamic service discovery
* Load balancing
* TLS termination
* HTTP/2 and gRPC proxies
* Circuit breakers
* Health checks
* Staged rollouts with %-based traffic split
* Fault injection
* Rich metrics

This sidecar deployment allows Istio to extract a wealth of signals about traffic behavior as
[attributes](/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/mixer-overview/#attributes).
Istio can use these attributes to enforce policy decisions, and send them to monitoring systems
to provide information about the behavior of the entire mesh.

The sidecar proxy model also allows you to add Istio capabilities to an
existing deployment with no need to rearchitect or rewrite code. You can read
more about why we chose this approach in our
[Design Goals](#design-goals).

Some of the Istio features and tasks enabled by Envoy proxies include:

* Traffic control features: enforce fine-grained traffic control with rich
  routing rules for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic.

* Network resiliency features: setup retries, failovers, circuit breakers, and
  fault injection.

* Security and authentication features: enforce security policies and enforce
  access control and rate limiting defined through the configuration API.

* Pluggable extensions model based on WebAssembly that allows for custom policy
  enforcement and telemetry generation for mesh traffic.

### Istiod

Istiod provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management.

Istiod converts high level routing rules that control traffic behavior into
Envoy-specific configurations, and propagates them to the sidecars at runtime.
Pilot abstracts platform-specific service discovery mechanisms and synthesizes
them into a standard format that any sidecar conforming with the
[Envoy API](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api/api) can consume.

Istio can support discovery for multiple environments such as Kubernetes,
Consul, or VMs.

You can use Istio's
[Traffic Management API](/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#introducing-istio-traffic-management)
to instruct Istiod to refine the Envoy configuration to exercise more granular control
over the traffic in your service mesh.

Istiod [security](/docs/concepts/security/) enables strong service-to-service and
end-user authentication with built-in identity and credential management. You
can use Istio to upgrade unencrypted traffic in the service mesh. Using
Istio, operators can enforce policies based on service identity rather than
on relatively unstable layer 3 or layer 4 network identifiers. Starting from
release 0.5, you can use [Istio's authorization feature](/docs/concepts/security/#authorization)
to control who can access your services.

Istiod maintains a CA and generates certificates to allow secure mTLS communication
in the data plane.
