Kubernetes has a unique and permissive networking model. In order to configure L2-L4 networking between Pods, [a Kubernetes cluster requires an _interface_ Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/). This plugin runs whenever a new pod is created, and sets up the network environment for that pod.

If you are using a hosted Kubernetes provider, you usually have limited choice in what CNI plugin you get in your cluster: it is an implementation detail of the hosted implementation.

In order to configure mesh traffic redirection, regardless of what CNI you or your provider choose to use for L2-L4 networking, Istio includes a _chained_ CNI plugin, which runs after all configured CNI interface plugins. The API for defining chained and interface plugins, and for sharing data between them, is part of the [CNI specification](https://www.cni.dev/). Istio works with all CNI implementations that follow the CNI standard, in both sidecar and ambient mode.

The Istio CNI plugin is optional in sidecar mode, and required in {{<gloss>}}ambient{{< /gloss >}} mode.
