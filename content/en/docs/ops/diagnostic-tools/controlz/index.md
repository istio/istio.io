Istiod is build with a flexible introspection framework, called ControlZ, which makes it easy to inspect and manipulate the internal state
of an istiod instance. Istiod opens a port which can be used from a web browser to get an interactive view into its state,
or via REST for access and control from external tools.

When Istiod starts, a message is logged indicating the IP address and port to connect to in order to interact with ControlZ.

Here's sample of the ControlZ interface:

To access the ControlZ page of istiod, you can port-forward its ControlZ endpoint
locally and connect through your local browser:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl dashboard controlz <istiod pod name> -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}

This will redirect the component's ControlZ page to `http://localhost:9876` for remote access.
