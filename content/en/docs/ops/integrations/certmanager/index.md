[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is a tool that automates certificate management. This can be integrated with Istio gateways to manage TLS certificates.

## Configuration

Consult the [cert-manager installation documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) to get started. No special changes are needed to work with Istio.

## Usage

### Istio Gateway

cert-manager can be used to write a secret to Kubernetes, which can then be referenced by a Gateway. To get started, configure a `Certificate` resource, following the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/). The `Certificate` should be created in the same namespace as the `istio-ingressgateway` deployment. For example, a `Certificate` may look like:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: ingress-cert
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  secretName: ingress-cert
  commonName: my.example.com
  dnsNames:
  - my.example.com
  ...
{{< /text >}}

Once we have the certificate created, we should see the secret created in the `istio-system` namespace. This can then be referenced in the `tls` config for a Gateway under `credentialName`:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 443
      name: https
      protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      credentialName: ingress-cert # This should match the Certificate secretName
    hosts:
    - my.example.com # This should match a DNS name in the Certificate
{{< /text >}}

### Kubernetes Ingress

cert-manager provides direct integration with Kubernetes Ingress by configuring an [annotation on the Ingress object](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/). If this method is used, the Ingress must reside in the same namespace as the `istio-ingressgateway` deployment, as secrets will only be read within the same namespace.

Alternatively, a `Certificate` can be created as described in [Istio Gateway](#istio-gateway), then referenced in the `Ingress` object:

{{< text yaml >}}
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
Kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: istio
spec:
  rules:
  - host: my.example.com
    http: ...
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - my.example.com # This should match a DNS name in the Certificate
    secretName: ingress-cert # This should match the Certificate secretName
{{< /text >}}
