Follow this guide to install and configure an Istio mesh using
[Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) for in-depth evaluation. The Helm charts used
in this guide are the same underlying charts used when
installing Istio via [Istioctl](/docs/setup/install/istioctl/) or the
[Operator](/docs/setup/install/operator/).

This feature is currently considered [alpha](/about/feature-stages/).

{{< boilerplate helm-hub-tag >}}

## Prerequisites

1. [Download the Istio release](/docs/setup/getting-started/#download).

1. Perform any necessary [platform-specific setup](/docs/setup/platform-setup/).

1. Check the [Requirements for Pods and Services](/docs/ops/deployment/requirements/).

1. [Install a Helm client](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) with a version higher than 3.1.1.

    {{< warning >}}
    Helm 2 is not supported for installing Istio.
    {{< /warning >}}

The commands in this guide use the Helm charts that are included in the Istio release package located at `manifests/charts`.

## Installation steps

Change directory to the root of the release package and then
follow the instructions below.

{{< warning >}}
The default chart configuration uses the secure third party tokens for the service
account token projections used by Istio proxies to authenticate with the Istio
control plane. Before proceeding to install any of the charts below, you should
verify if third party tokens are enabled in your cluster by following the steps
describe [here](/docs/ops/best-practices/security/#configure-third-party-service-account-tokens).
If third party tokens are not enabled, you should add the option
`--set global.jwtPolicy=first-party-jwt` to the Helm install commands.
If the `jwtPolicy` is not set correctly, pods associated with `istiod`,
gateways or workloads with injected Envoy proxies will not get deployed due
to the missing `istio-token` volume.
{{< /warning >}}

1. Create a namespace `istio-system` for Istio components:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl create namespace istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. Install the Istio base chart which contains cluster-wide resources used by
   the Istio control plane:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm install istio-base manifests/charts/base -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. Install the Istio discovery chart which deploys the `istiod` service:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm install istiod manifests/charts/istio-control/istio-discovery \
        -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. (Optional) Install the Istio ingress gateway chart which contains the ingress
   gateway components:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm install istio-ingress manifests/charts/gateways/istio-ingress \
        -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. (Optional) Install the Istio egress gateway chart which contains the egress
   gateway components:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm install istio-egress manifests/charts/gateways/istio-egress \
        -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

## Verifying the installation

1. Ensure all Kubernetes pods in `istio-system` namespace are deployed and have a
   `STATUS` of `Running`:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl get pods -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

## Updating your Istio configuration

You can provide override settings specific to any Istio Helm chart used above
and follow the Helm upgrade workflow to customize your Istio mesh installation.
The available configurable options can be found by inspecting the top level
`values.yaml` file associated with the Helm charts located at `manifests/charts`
inside the Istio release package specific to your version.

{{< warning >}}
Note that the Istio Helm chart values are under active development and
considered experimental. Upgrading to newer versions of Istio can involve
migrating your override values to follow the new API.
{{< /warning >}}

For customizations that are supported via both
[`ProxyConfig`](/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#ProxyConfig) and Helm
values, using `ProxyConfig` is recommended because it provides schema
validation while unstructured Helm values do not.

## Upgrading using Helm

Before upgrading Istio in your cluster, we recommend creating a backup of your
custom configurations, and restoring it from backup if necessary:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl get istio-io --all-namespaces -oyaml > $HOME/istio_resource_backup.yaml
{{< /text >}}

You can restore your custom configuration like this:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl apply -f $HOME/istio_resource_backup.yaml
{{< /text >}}

### Migrating from non-Helm installations

If you're migrating from a version of Istio installed using `istioctl` or
Operator to Helm, you need to delete your current Istio control plane resources
and and re-install Istio using Helm as described above. When deleting your
current Istio installation, you must not remove the Istio Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs) as that can lead to loss of your custom Istio resources.

{{< warning >}}
It is highly recommended to take a backup of your Istio resources using steps
described above before deleting current Istio installation in your cluster.
{{< /warning >}}

You can follow steps mentioned in the
[Istioctl uninstall guide](/docs/setup/install/istioctl#uninstall-istio) or
[Operator uninstall guide](/docs/setup/install/operator/#uninstall)
depending upon your installation method.

### Canary upgrade (recommended)

You can install a canary version of Istio control plane to validate that the new
version is compatible with your existing configuration and data plane using
the steps below:

{{< warning >}}
Note that when you install a canary version of the `istiod` service, the underlying
cluster-wide resources from the base chart are shared across your
primary and canary installations.

Currently, the support for canary upgrades for Istio ingress and egress
gateways is [actively in development](/docs/setup/upgrade/gateways/) and is considered `experimental`.
{{< /warning >}}

1. Install a canary version of the Istio discovery chart by setting the revision
   value:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm install istiod-canary manifests/charts/istio-control/istio-discovery \
        --set revision=canary \
        -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. Verify that you have two versions of `istiod` installed in your cluster:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl get pods -l app=istiod -L istio.io/rev -n istio-system
      NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   REV
      istiod-5649c48ddc-dlkh8         1/1     Running   0          71m   default
      istiod-canary-9cc9fd96f-jpc7n   1/1     Running   0          34m   canary
    {{< /text >}}

1. Follow the steps [here](/docs/setup/upgrade/#data-plane) to test or migrate
   existing workloads to use the canary control plane.

1. Once you have verified and migrated your workloads to use the canary control
   plane, you can uninstall your old control plane:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm delete istiod -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

### In place upgrade

You can perform an in place upgrade of Istio in your cluster using the Helm
upgrade workflow.

{{< warning >}}
This upgrade path is only supported from Istio version 1.8 and above.

Add your override values file or custom options to the commands below to
preserve your custom configuration during Helm upgrades.
{{< /warning >}}

1. Upgrade the Istio base chart:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm upgrade istio-base manifests/charts/base -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. Upgrade the Istio discovery chart:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm upgrade istiod manifests/charts/istio-control/istio-discovery \
        -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. (Optional) Upgrade the Istio ingress or egress gateway charts if installed in
   your cluster:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm upgrade istio-ingress manifests/charts/gateways/istio-ingress \
        -n istio-system
    $ helm upgrade istio-egress manifests/charts/gateways/istio-egress \
        -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

## Uninstall

You can uninstall Istio and its components by uninstalling the charts
installed above.

1. List all the Istio charts installed in `istio-system` namespace:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm ls -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. (Optional) Delete Istio ingress/egress chart:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm delete istio-egress -n istio-system
    $ helm delete istio-ingress -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. Delete Istio discovery chart:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm delete istiod -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. Delete Istio base chart:

    {{< warning >}}
    By design, deleting a chart via Helm doesn't delete the installed Custom
    Resource Definitions (CRDs) installed via the chart.
    {{< /warning >}}

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ helm delete istio-base -n istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

1. Delete the `istio-system` namespace:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl delete namespace istio-system
    {{< /text >}}

### (Optional) Deleting CRDs installed by Istio

Deleting CRDs permanently removes any Istio resources you have created in your
cluster. To permanently delete Istio CRDs installed in your cluster:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl get crd | grep --color=never 'istio.io' | awk '{print $1}' \
        | xargs -n1 kubectl delete crd
    {{< /text >}}
