Follow this guide to install the Istio control plane on `cluster1` (the
{{< gloss >}}primary cluster{{< /gloss >}}) and configure `cluster2` (the
{{< gloss >}}remote cluster{{< /gloss >}}) to use the control plane in `cluster1`.
Both clusters reside on the `network1` network, meaning there is direct
connectivity between the pods in both clusters.

Before proceeding, be sure to complete the steps under
[before you begin](/docs/setup/install/multicluster/before-you-begin).

{{< boilerplate multi-cluster-with-metallb >}}

In this configuration, cluster `cluster1` will observe the API Servers in
both clusters for endpoints. In this way, the control plane will be able to
provide service discovery for workloads in both clusters.

Service workloads communicate directly (pod-to-pod) across cluster boundaries.

Services in `cluster2` will reach the control plane in `cluster1` via a
dedicated gateway for [east-west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-west_traffic)
traffic.

{{< tip >}}
Today, the remote profile will install an istiod server in the remote
cluster which will be used for CA and webhook injection for workloads
in that cluster. Service discovery, however, will be directed to the
control plane in the primary cluster.

Future releases will remove the need for having an istiod in the
remote cluster altogether. Stay tuned!

## Configure `cluster1` as a primary

Create the Istio configuration for `cluster1`:

{{< text bash >}}
$ cat <<EOF > cluster1.yaml
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
spec:
  values:
    global:
      meshID: mesh1
      multiCluster:
        clusterName: cluster1
      network: network1
EOF
{{< /text >}}

Apply the configuration to `cluster1`:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl install --context="${CTX_CLUSTER1}" -f cluster1.yaml
{{< /text >}}

## Install the east-west gateway in `cluster1`

Install a gateway in `cluster1` that is dedicated to
[east-west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-west_traffic) traffic. By
default, this gateway will be public on the Internet. Production systems may
require additional access restrictions (e.g. via firewall rules) to prevent
external attacks. Check with your cloud vendor to see what options are
available.

{{< text bash >}}
$ @samples/multicluster/gen-eastwest-gateway.sh@ \
    --mesh mesh1 --cluster cluster1 --network network1 | \
    istioctl --context="${CTX_CLUSTER1}" install -y -f -
{{< /text >}}

{{< warning >}}
If the control-plane was installed with a revision, add the `--revision rev` flag to the `gen-eastwest-gateway.sh` command.
{{< /warning >}}

Wait for the east-west gateway to be assigned an external IP address:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl --context="${CTX_CLUSTER1}" get svc istio-eastwestgateway -n istio-system
NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)   AGE
istio-eastwestgateway   LoadBalancer   10.80.6.124   34.75.71.237   ...       51s
{{< /text >}}

## Expose the control plane in `cluster1`

Before we can install on `cluster2`, we need to first expose the control plane in
`cluster1` so that services in `cluster2` will be able to access service discovery:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl apply --context="${CTX_CLUSTER1}" -n istio-system -f \
    @samples/multicluster/expose-istiod.yaml@
{{< /text >}}

## Enable API Server Access to `cluster2`

Before we can configure the remote cluster, we first have to give the control
plane in `cluster1` access to the API Server in `cluster2`. This will do the
following:

- Enables the control plane to authenticate connection requests from
  workloads running in `cluster2`. Without API Server access, the control
  plane will reject the requests.

- Enables discovery of service endpoints running in `cluster2`.

To provide API Server access to `cluster2`, we generate a remote secret and
apply it to `cluster1`:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl x create-remote-secret \
    --context="${CTX_CLUSTER2}" \
    --name=cluster2 | \
    kubectl apply -f - --context="${CTX_CLUSTER1}"
{{< /text >}}

## Configure `cluster2` as a remote

Save the address of `cluster1`â€™s east-west gateway.

{{< text bash >}}
$ export DISCOVERY_ADDRESS=$(kubectl \
    --context="${CTX_CLUSTER1}" \
    -n istio-system get svc istio-eastwestgateway \
    -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
{{< /text >}}

Now create a remote configuration for `cluster2`.

{{< text bash >}}
$ cat <<EOF > cluster2.yaml
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
spec:
  values:
    global:
      meshID: mesh1
      multiCluster:
        clusterName: cluster2
      network: network1
      remotePilotAddress: ${DISCOVERY_ADDRESS}
EOF
{{< /text >}}

Apply the configuration to `cluster2`:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl install --context="${CTX_CLUSTER2}" -f cluster2.yaml
{{< /text >}}

**Congratulations!** You successfully installed an Istio mesh across primary
and remote clusters!
