Follow this guide to install and configure an Istio mesh for in-depth evaluation or production use.
If you are new to Istio, and just want to try it out, follow the
[quick start instructions](/docs/setup/getting-started) instead.

This installation guide uses the [istioctl](/docs/reference/commands/istioctl/) command line
tool to provide rich customization of the Istio control plane and of the sidecars for the Istio data plane.
It has user input validation to help prevent installation errors and customization options to
override any aspect of the configuration.

Using these instructions, you can select any one of Istio's built-in
[configuration profiles](/docs/setup/additional-setup/config-profiles/)
and then further customize the configuration for your specific needs.

The `istioctl` command supports the full [`IstioOperator` API](/docs/reference/config/istio.operator.v1alpha1/)
via command-line options for individual settings or for passing a yaml file containing an `IstioOperator`
{{<gloss CRDs>}}custom resource (CR){{</gloss>}}.

{{< tip >}}
Providing the full configuration in an `IstioOperator` CR is considered an Istio best practice for production
environments. It also gives you the option of completely delegating the job of install management to an
[Istio Operator](/docs/setup/install/operator), instead of doing it manually using `istioctl`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, check the following prerequisites:

1. [Download the Istio release](/docs/setup/getting-started/#download).
1. Perform any necessary [platform-specific setup](/docs/setup/platform-setup/).
1. Check the [Requirements for Pods and Services](/docs/ops/deployment/requirements/).

## Install Istio using the default profile

The simplest option is to install the `default` Istio
[configuration profile](/docs/setup/additional-setup/config-profiles/)
using the following command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl install
{{< /text >}}

This command installs the `default` profile on the cluster defined by your
Kubernetes configuration. The `default` profile is a good starting point
for establishing a production environment, unlike the larger `demo` profile that
is intended for evaluating a broad set of Istio features.

Various settings can be configured to modify the installations. For example, to enable access logs:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl install --set meshConfig.accessLogFile=/dev/stdout
{{< /text >}}

{{< tip >}}
Many of the examples on this page and elsewhere in the documentation are written using `--set` to modify installation
parameters, rather than passing a configuration file with `-f`. This is done to make the examples more compact.
The two methods are equivalent, but `-f` is strongly recommended for production. The above command would be written as
follows using `-f`:

{{< text yaml >}}
# my-config.yaml
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
spec:
  meshConfig:
    accessLogFile: /dev/stdout
{{< /text >}}

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl install -f my-config.yaml
{{< /text >}}

{{< /tip >}}

{{< tip >}}
The full API is documented in the [`IstioOperator` API reference](/docs/reference/config/istio.operator.v1alpha1/).
In general, you can use the `--set` flag in `istioctl` as you would with
Helm, and the Helm `values.yaml` API is currently supported for backwards compatibility. The only difference is you must
prefix the legacy `values.yaml` paths with `values.` because this is the prefix for the Helm pass-through API.

## Install from external charts

By default, `istioctl` uses compiled-in charts to generate the install manifest. These charts are released together with
`istioctl` for auditing and customization purposes and can be found in the release tar in the
`manifests` directory.
`istioctl` can also use external charts rather than the compiled-in ones. To select external charts, set
the `manifests` flag to a local file system path:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl install --manifests=manifests/
{{< /text >}}

If using the `istioctl` {{< istio_full_version >}} binary, this command will result in the same installation as `istioctl install` alone, because it points to the
same charts as the compiled-in ones.
Other than for experimenting with or testing new features, we recommend using the compiled-in charts rather than external ones to ensure compatibility of the
`istioctl` binary with the charts.

## Install a different profile

Other Istio configuration profiles can be installed in a cluster by passing the
profile name on the command line. For example, the following command can be used
to install the `demo` profile:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl install --set profile=demo
{{< /text >}}

## Check what's installed

The `istioctl` command saves the `IstioOperator` CR that was used to install Istio in a copy of the CR named `installed-state`.
Instead of inspecting the deployments, pods, services and other resources that were installed by Istio, for example:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl -n istio-system get deploy
NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
istio-egressgateway    1/1     1            1           25s
istio-ingressgateway   1/1     1            1           24s
istiod                 1/1     1            1           20s
{{< /text >}}

You can inspect the `installed-state` CR, to see what is installed in the cluster, as well as all custom settings.
For example, dump its content into a YAML file using the following command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl -n istio-system get IstioOperator installed-state -o yaml > installed-state.yaml
{{< /text >}}

The `installed-state` CR is also used to perform checks in some `istioctl` commands and should therefore not be removed.

## Display the list of available profiles

You can display the names of Istio configuration profiles that are
accessible to `istioctl` by using this command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl profile list
Istio configuration profiles:
    default
    demo
    empty
    minimal
    openshift
    preview
    remote
{{< /text >}}

## Display the configuration of a profile

You can view the configuration settings of a profile. For example, to view the setting for the `demo` profile
run the following command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl profile dump demo
components:
  egressGateways:
  - enabled: true
    k8s:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 10m
          memory: 40Mi
    name: istio-egressgateway

...
{{< /text >}}

To view a subset of the entire configuration, you can use the `--config-path` flag, which selects only the portion
of the configuration under the given path:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl profile dump --config-path components.pilot demo
enabled: true
k8s:
  env:
  - name: PILOT_TRACE_SAMPLING
    value: "100"
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 100Mi
{{< /text >}}

## Show differences in profiles

The `profile diff` sub-command can be used to show the differences between profiles,
which is useful for checking the effects of customizations before applying changes to a cluster.

You can show differences between the default and demo profiles using these commands:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl profile diff default demo
 gateways:
   egressGateways:
-  - enabled: false
+  - enabled: true
...
     k8s:
        requests:
-          cpu: 100m
-          memory: 128Mi
+          cpu: 10m
+          memory: 40Mi
       strategy:
...
{{< /text >}}

## Generate a manifest before installation

You can generate the manifest before installing Istio using the `manifest generate`
sub-command.
For example, use the following command to generate a manifest for the `default` profile:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl manifest generate > $HOME/generated-manifest.yaml
{{< /text >}}

The generated manifest can be used to inspect what exactly is installed as well as to track changes to the manifest
over time. While the `IstioOperator` CR represents the full user configuration and is sufficient for tracking it,
the output from `manifest generate` also captures possible changes in the underlying charts and therefore can be
used to track the actual installed resources.

The output from `manifest generate` can also be used to install Istio using `kubectl apply` or equivalent. However,
these alternative installation methods may not apply the resources with the same sequencing of dependencies as
`istioctl install` and are not tested in an Istio release.

{{< warning >}}
If attempting to install and manage Istio using `istioctl manifest generate`, please note the following caveats:

1. The Istio namespace (`istio-system` by default) must be created manually.

1. While `istioctl install` will automatically detect environment specific settings from your Kubernetes context,
`manifest generate` cannot as it runs offline, which may lead to unexpected results. In particular, you must ensure
that you follow [these steps](/docs/ops/best-practices/security/#configure-third-party-service-account-tokens) if your
Kubernetes environment does not support third party service account tokens.

1. `kubectl apply` of the generated manifest may show transient errors due to resources not being available in the
cluster in the correct order.

1. `istioctl install` automatically prunes any resources that should be removed when the configuration changes (e.g.
if you remove a gateway). This does not happen when you use `istio manifest generate` with `kubectl` and these
resources must be removed manually.

{{< /warning >}}

## Show differences in manifests

You can show the differences in the generated manifests in a YAML style diff between the default profile and a
customized install using these commands:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl manifest generate > 1.yaml
$ istioctl manifest generate -f samples/operator/pilot-k8s.yaml > 2.yaml
$ istioctl manifest diff 1.yaml 2.yaml
Differences of manifests are:

Object Deployment:istio-system:istio-pilot has diffs:

spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        '[0]':
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 500m -> 1000m
              memory: 2048Mi -> 4096Mi
      nodeSelector: -> map[master:true]
      tolerations: -> [map[effect:NoSchedule key:dedicated operator:Exists] map[key:CriticalAddonsOnly
        operator:Exists]]


Object HorizontalPodAutoscaler:istio-system:istio-pilot has diffs:

spec:
  maxReplicas: 5 -> 10
  minReplicas: 1 -> 2
{{< /text >}}

## Verify a successful installation

You can check if the Istio installation succeeded using the `verify-install` command
which compares the installation on your cluster to a manifest you specify.

If you didn't generate your manifest prior to deployment, run the following command to
generate it now:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl manifest generate <your original installation options> > $HOME/generated-manifest.yaml
{{< /text >}}

Then run the following `verify-install` command to see if the installation was successful:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl verify-install -f $HOME/generated-manifest.yaml
{{< /text >}}

See [Customizing the installation configuration](/docs/setup/additional-setup/customize-installation/) for additional information on customizing the install.

## Uninstall Istio

To completely uninstall Istio from a cluster, run the following command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl x uninstall --purge
{{< /text >}}

{{< warning >}}
The optional `--purge` flag will remove all Istio resources, including cluster-scoped resources that may be shared with other Istio control planes.
{{< /warning >}}

Alternatively, to remove only a specific Istio control plane, run the following command:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl x uninstall <your original installation options>
{{< /text >}}

or

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl manifest generate <your original installation options> | kubectl delete -f -
{{< /text >}}

The control plane namespace (e.g., `istio-system`) is not removed by default.
If no longer needed, use the following command to remove it:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl delete namespace istio-system
{{< /text >}}
