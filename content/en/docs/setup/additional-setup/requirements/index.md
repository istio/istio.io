To be a part of an Istio service mesh, pods and services in a Kubernetes
cluster must satisfy the following requirements:

- **Service association**: A pod must belong to at least one Kubernetes
  service even if the pod does NOT expose any port.
  If a pod belongs to multiple [Kubernetes services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/),
  the services cannot use the same port number for different protocols, for
  instance HTTP and TCP.

- **Deployments with app and version labels**: We recommend adding an explicit
  `app` label and `version` label to deployments. Add the labels  to the
  deployment specification of pods deployed using the Kubernetes `Deployment`.
  The `app` and `version` labels add contextual information to the metrics and
  telemetry Istio collects.

    - The `app` label: Each deployment specification should have a distinct
      `app` label with a meaningful value. The `app` label is used to add
      contextual information in distributed tracing.

    - The `version` label: This label indicates the version of the application
      corresponding to the particular deployment.

- **Application UIDs**: Ensure your pods do **not** run applications as a user
  with the user ID (UID) value of **1337**.

- **`NET_ADMIN` capability**: If your cluster enforces pod security policies,
  pods must allow the `NET_ADMIN` capability. If you use the [Istio CNI Plugin](/docs/setup/additional-setup/cni/),
  this requirement no longer applies. To learn more about the `NET_ADMIN`
  capability, visit [Required Pod Capabilities](/docs/ops/setup/required-pod-capabilities/).

## Ports used by Istio

The following ports and protocols are used by Istio. Ensure that there are no TCP headless services using a TCP port used by one of Istio's services.

| 8080 | HTTP | Citadel agent | SDS service monitoring |
| 9090 | HTTP |  Prometheus | Prometheus |
| 9091 | HTTP | Mixer | Policy/Telemetry |
| 9876 | HTTP | Citadel, Citadel agent |  ControlZ user interface |
| 9901 | GRPC | Galley| Mesh Configuration Protocol |
| 15000 | TCP | Envoy | Envoy admin port (commands/diagnostics) |
| 15001 | TCP | Envoy | Envoy Outbound |
| 15006 | TCP | Envoy | Envoy Inbound |

| 15011 | TCP | Pilot | Pilot service - `mTLS` - Proxy - discovery |
| 15014 | HTTP | Citadel, Citadel agent, Galley, Mixer, Pilot, Sidecar Injector | Control plane monitoring |
