Follow these instructions to prepare an
[Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes Container Service](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/kubernetes)
cluster for Istio.
You can deploy a Kubernetes cluster to Alibaba Cloud quickly and easily in the
`Container Service console`, which fully supports Istio.

{{< tip >}}
Alibaba Cloud offers a fully managed service mesh platform named Alibaba Cloud Service Mesh (ASM),
 which is fully compatible with Istio. Refer to
 [Alibaba Cloud Service Mesh](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/147513.htm) for
 details and instructions.

## Prerequisites

1. [Follow the Alibaba Cloud instructions](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/95108.htm)

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `Container Service console`, and click **Clusters** under
**Kubernetes** in the left-side navigation pane to enter the **Cluster List** page.

1. Click the **Create Kubernetes Cluster** button in the upper-right corner.

1. Enter the cluster name. The cluster name can be 1â€“63 characters long and
it can contain numbers, Chinese characters, English letters, and hyphens (-).

1. Select the **region** and **zone** in which the cluster resides.
