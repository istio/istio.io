An Istio service mesh is logically split into a data plane and a control plane.

The {{< gloss >}}data plane{{< /gloss >}} is the set of proxies that mediate and control all network communication between microservices. They also collect and report telemetry on all mesh traffic.

The {{< gloss >}}control plane{{< /gloss >}} manages and configures the proxies in the data plane.

Istio supports two main {{< gloss "data plane mode">}}data plane modes{{< /gloss >}}:

* **sidecar mode**, which deploys an Envoy proxy along with each pod that you start in your cluster, or running alongside services running on VMs.
* **ambient mode**, which uses a per-node Layer 4 proxy, and optionally a per-namespace Envoy proxy for Layer 7 features.

The two modes can interoperate with one another<sup>[α](#supported-features)</sup>, and you can opt certain namespaces or workloads into each mode.

## Sidecar mode

Istio has been built on the sidecar pattern from its first release in 2017. Sidecar mode is well understood and thoroughly battle-tested, but comes with a resource cost and operational overhead.

* Each application you deploy has an Envoy proxy {{< gloss "injection" >}}injected{{< /gloss >}} as a sidecar
* All proxies can process both Layer 4 and Layer 7

## Ambient mode

Launched in 2022, ambient mode was built to address the shortcomings reported by users of sidecar mode. As of Istio 1.22, it is production-ready for single cluster use cases.

* All traffic is proxied through a Layer 4-only node proxy
* Applications can opt in to routing through an Envoy proxy to get Layer 7 features

## Choosing between sidecar and ambient

Users often deploy a mesh to enable a zero-trust security posture as a first-step and then selectively enable L7 capabilities as needed. Ambient mesh allows those users to bypass the cost of L7 processing entirely when it’s not needed.

## Layer 4 vs Layer 7 features

The overhead for processing protocols at Layer 7 is substantially higher than processing network packets at Layer 4. For a given service, if your requirements can be met at L4, service mesh can be delivered at substantially lower cost.
