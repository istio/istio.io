This task shows you how to set up an Istio authorization policy using a new [experimental annotation `istio.io/dry-run`](/docs/reference/config/annotations/)
to dry-run the policy without actually enforcing it.

The dry-run annotation allows you to better understand the effect of an authorization policy before applying it to
the production traffic. This helps to reduce the risk of breaking the production traffic caused by incorrect authorization policy.

{{< boilerplate experimental-feature-warning >}}

## Before you begin

Before you begin this task, do the following:

* Read the [Istio authorization concepts](/docs/concepts/security/#authorization).

* Follow the [Istio installation guide](/docs/setup/install/istioctl/) to install Istio.

* Deploy Zipkin for checking dry-run tracing results. Follow the [Zipkin task](/docs/tasks/observability/distributed-tracing/zipkin/)
  to install Zipkin in the cluster. Make sure the sampling rate is set to 100 that allows you to quickly reproduce the trace span in the task.

* Deploy Prometheus for checking dry-run metric results. Follow [Prometheus task](/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/querying-metrics/)
  to install the Prometheus in the cluster.

* Deploy test workloads:

    This task uses two workloads, `httpbin` and `sleep`, both deployed in namespace `foo`.
    Both workloads run with an Envoy proxy sidecar. Deploy the `foo` namespace and workloads with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl create ns foo
    $ kubectl label ns foo istio-injection=enabled
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml@ -n foo
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/sleep/sleep.yaml@ -n foo
    {{< /text >}}

* Enable proxy debug level log for checking dry-run logging results:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl proxy-config log deploy/httpbin.foo --level "rbac:debug" | grep rbac
    rbac: debug
    {{< /text >}}

* Verify that `sleep` can access `httpbin` with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n foo -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})" -c sleep -n foo -- curl http://httpbin.foo:8000/ip -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
    200
    {{< /text >}}

{{< warning >}}
If you donâ€™t see the expected output as you follow the task, retry after a few seconds.
Caching and propagation overhead can cause some delay.

## Create dry-run policy

1. Create the authorization policy with dry-run annotation `"istio.io/dry-run": "true"` with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -n foo -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
    kind: AuthorizationPolicy
    metadata:
      name: deny-path-headers
      annotations:
        "istio.io/dry-run": "true"
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: httpbin
      action: DENY
      rules:
      - to:
        - operation:
            paths: ["/headers"]
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

1. Verify a request to path `/headers` is allowed because the policy is created in dry-run mode:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n foo -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})" -c sleep -n foo -- curl "http://httpbin.foo:8000/headers" -s
    {{< /text >}}

## Check dry-run result in proxy log

1. Run the following command to check the dry-run results in the proxy log. Note this requires you have enabled the
   debug logging in the proxy. Try to send some more requests if you do not see the expected log.

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl logs "$(kubectl get pod -l app=httpbin -n foo -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})" -c istio-proxy -n foo  | grep shadow
    2021-04-20T02:33:16.294417Z debug envoy rbac shadow denied, matched policy ns[foo]-policy[deny-path-headers]-rule[0]
    {{< /text >}}

1. The log `shadow denied, matched policy ns[foo]-policy[deny-path-headers]-rule[0]` means the request is rejected
   by the dry-run policy `deny-path-headers` in the namespace `foo`.

## Check dry-run result in metric using Prometheus

1. Open the Prometheus dashboard with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl dashboard prometheus
    {{< /text >}}

1. In the Prometheus dashboard, search for the metric `envoy_http_inbound_0_0_0_0_80_rbac{authz_dry_run_result!=""}`. The
   following is an example metric output (you might find different values of these metrics):

    {{< text plain >}}
    envoy_http_inbound_0_0_0_0_80_rbac{app="httpbin",authz_dry_run_action="deny",authz_dry_run_result="allowed",instance="10.44.1.11:15020",istio_io_rev="default",job="kubernetes-pods",kubernetes_namespace="foo",kubernetes_pod_name="httpbin-74fb669cc6-95qm8",pod_template_hash="74fb669cc6",security_istio_io_tlsMode="istio",service_istio_io_canonical_name="httpbin",service_istio_io_canonical_revision="v1",version="v1"} 0
    envoy_http_inbound_0_0_0_0_80_rbac{app="httpbin",authz_dry_run_action="deny",authz_dry_run_result="denied",instance="10.44.1.11:15020",istio_io_rev="default",job="kubernetes-pods",kubernetes_namespace="foo",kubernetes_pod_name="httpbin-74fb669cc6-95qm8",pod_template_hash="74fb669cc6",security_istio_io_tlsMode="istio",service_istio_io_canonical_name="httpbin",service_istio_io_canonical_revision="v1",version="v1"}  1
    {{< /text >}}

1. The metric `envoy_http_inbound_0_0_0_0_80_rbac{authz_dry_run_result="denied"}` has value `1` (you might find different
   value depending on how many requests you have sent. It's expected as long as the value is greater than 0).
   This means the dry-run policy applied to the `httpbin` workload on port `80` matched one request. The policy would
   reject the request once if it was not in dry-run mode.

## Check dry-run result in tracing using Zipkin

1. Open the Zipkin dashboard with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl dashboard zipkin
    {{< /text >}}

1. Find the trace result for the request from `sleep` to `httpbin`. Make sure you have set the sampling rate to 100 so
   that you can quickly reproduce the trace result in this task. Try to send some more requests if you do see the trace
   result.

1. In the trace result, you should find the following custom tags indicating the request is rejected by the dry-run policy
   `deny-path-headers` in the namespace `foo`:

    {{< text plain >}}
    istio.authorization.dry_run.deny_policy.name: ns[foo]-policy[deny-path-headers]-rule[0]
    istio.authorization.dry_run.deny_policy.result: denied
    {{< /text >}}

## Summary

The Proxy debug log, Prometheus metric and Zipkin trace result indicate that the dry-run policy will reject the request.
You can further change the policy if the dry-run result is not expected.

It's recommended to keep the dry-run policy for some more time to so that it can be tested with more production traffic.

When you are confident about the dry-run result, you can change the policy from dry-run to enforce mode. This can be
achieved by either of the following approaches:

* Remove the dry-run annotation completely; or

* Change the value of the dry-run annotation to `false`;

## Limitations

The dry-run annotation is currently in experimental stage and has the following limitations:

* The dry-run annotation currently only supports ALLOW and DENY policies;

* There will be two separate dry-run results (i.e. log, metric and tracing tag) for ALLOW and DENY policies due to the fact
  that the ALLOW and DENY policies are enforced separately in the proxy. You should take all the two dry-run results into
  consideration because a request could be allowed by an ALLOW policy but still rejected by another DENY policy;

* The dry-run results in the proxy log, metric and tracing are for manual troubleshooting purpose and should not be used
  as an API because it may change anytime without prior notice;

## Clean up

1. Remove the namespace `foo` from your configuration:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl delete namespace foo
    {{< /text >}}

1. Remove the Prometheus and Zipkin if not needed.
