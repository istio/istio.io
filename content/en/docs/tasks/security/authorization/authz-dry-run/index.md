This task shows you how to set up an Istio authorization policy using a new [experimental annotation `istio.io/dry-run`](/docs/reference/config/annotations/)
to dry-run the policy without actually enforcing it.

The dry-run annotation allows you to better understand the effect of an authorization policy before applying it to
the production traffic. This helps to reduce the risk of breaking the production traffic caused by an incorrect authorization policy.

## Before you begin

Before you begin this task, do the following:

* Read the [Istio authorization concepts](/docs/concepts/security/#authorization).

* Follow the [Istio installation guide](/docs/setup/install/istioctl/) to install Istio.

* Deploy Zipkin for checking dry-run tracing results. Follow the [Zipkin task](/docs/tasks/observability/distributed-tracing/zipkin/)
  to install Zipkin in the cluster. Make sure the sampling rate is set to 100 which allows you to quickly reproduce the trace span in the task.

* Deploy Prometheus for checking dry-run metric results. Follow the [Prometheus task](/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/querying-metrics/)
  to install the Prometheus in the cluster.

* Deploy test workloads:

    This task uses two workloads, `httpbin` and `sleep`, both deployed in namespace `foo`.
    Both workloads run with an Envoy proxy sidecar. Create the `foo` namespace and deploy the workloads with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl create ns foo
    $ kubectl label ns foo istio-injection=enabled
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml@ -n foo
    $ kubectl apply -f @samples/sleep/sleep.yaml@ -n foo
    {{< /text >}}

* Enable proxy debug level log for checking dry-run logging results:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl proxy-config log deploy/httpbin.foo --level "rbac:debug" | grep rbac
    rbac: debug
    {{< /text >}}

* Verify that `sleep` can access `httpbin` with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n foo -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})" -c sleep -n foo -- curl http://httpbin.foo:8000/ip -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
    200
    {{< /text >}}

{{< warning >}}
If you donâ€™t see the expected output as you follow the task, retry after a few seconds.
Caching and propagation overhead can cause some delay.

## Create dry-run policy

1. Create an authorization policy with dry-run annotation `"istio.io/dry-run": "true"` with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -n foo -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
    kind: AuthorizationPolicy
    metadata:
      name: deny-path-headers
      annotations:
        "istio.io/dry-run": "true"
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: httpbin
      action: DENY
      rules:
      - to:
        - operation:
            paths: ["/headers"]
    EOF
    {{< /text >}}

1. Verify a request to path `/headers` is allowed because the policy is created in dry-run mode:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -n foo -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})" -c sleep -n foo -- curl "http://httpbin.foo:8000/headers" -s
    {{< /text >}}

## Check dry-run result in proxy log

1. The dry-run results can be found in the proxy debug log, similar to `shadow denied, matched policy ns[foo]-policy[deny-path-headers]-rule[0]`.
   See the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/ops/common-problems/security-issues/#ensure-proxies-enforce-policies-correctly) for more details.

## Check dry-run result in metric using Prometheus

1. Open the Prometheus dashboard with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl dashboard prometheus
    {{< /text >}}

1. In the Prometheus dashboard, search for the metric `envoy_http_inbound_0_0_0_0_80_rbac{authz_dry_run_result!=""}`. The
   following is an example metric output:

    {{< text plain >}}
    envoy_http_inbound_0_0_0_0_80_rbac{app="httpbin",authz_dry_run_action="deny",authz_dry_run_result="allowed",instance="10.44.1.11:15020",istio_io_rev="default",job="kubernetes-pods",kubernetes_namespace="foo",kubernetes_pod_name="httpbin-74fb669cc6-95qm8",pod_template_hash="74fb669cc6",security_istio_io_tlsMode="istio",service_istio_io_canonical_name="httpbin",service_istio_io_canonical_revision="v1",version="v1"} 0
    envoy_http_inbound_0_0_0_0_80_rbac{app="httpbin",authz_dry_run_action="deny",authz_dry_run_result="denied",instance="10.44.1.11:15020",istio_io_rev="default",job="kubernetes-pods",kubernetes_namespace="foo",kubernetes_pod_name="httpbin-74fb669cc6-95qm8",pod_template_hash="74fb669cc6",security_istio_io_tlsMode="istio",service_istio_io_canonical_name="httpbin",service_istio_io_canonical_revision="v1",version="v1"}  1
    {{< /text >}}

1. The metric `envoy_http_inbound_0_0_0_0_80_rbac{authz_dry_run_result="denied"}` has value `1` (you might find different
   value depending on how many requests you have sent. It's expected as long as the value is greater than 0).
   This means the dry-run policy applied to the `httpbin` workload on port `80` matched one request. The policy would
   reject the request once if it was not in dry-run mode.

## Check dry-run result in tracing using Zipkin

1. Open the Zipkin dashboard with the following command:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ istioctl dashboard zipkin
    {{< /text >}}

1. Find the trace result for the request from `sleep` to `httpbin`. Try to send some more requests if you do see the trace
   result due to the delay in the Zipkin.

1. In the trace result, you should find the following custom tags indicating the request is rejected by the dry-run policy
   `deny-path-headers` in the namespace `foo`:

    {{< text plain >}}
    istio.authorization.dry_run.deny_policy.name: ns[foo]-policy[deny-path-headers]-rule[0]
    istio.authorization.dry_run.deny_policy.result: denied
    {{< /text >}}

## Summary

The Proxy debug log, Prometheus metric and Zipkin trace results indicate that the dry-run policy will reject the request.
You can further change the policy if the dry-run result is not expected.

It's recommended to keep the dry-run policy for some additional time so that it can be tested with more production traffic.

When you are confident about the dry-run result, you can disable the dry-run mode so that the policy will start to actually
reject requests. This can be achieved by either of the following approaches:

* Remove the dry-run annotation completely; or

* Change the value of the dry-run annotation to `false`.

## Limitations

The dry-run annotation is currently in experimental stage and has the following limitations:

* The dry-run annotation currently only supports ALLOW and DENY policies;

* There will be two separate dry-run results (i.e. log, metric and tracing tag) for ALLOW and DENY policies due to the fact
  that the ALLOW and DENY policies are enforced separately in the proxy. You should take all the two dry-run results into
  consideration because a request could be allowed by an ALLOW policy but still rejected by another DENY policy;

* The dry-run results in the proxy log, metric and tracing are for manual troubleshooting purposes and should not be used
  as an API because it may change anytime without prior notice.

## Clean up

1. Remove the namespace `foo` from your configuration:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl delete namespace foo
    {{< /text >}}

1. Remove Prometheus and Zipkin if no longer needed.
