After completing this task, you understand how to have your application participate in tracing with [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/),
regardless of the language, framework, or platform you use to build your application.

This task uses the [Bookinfo](/docs/examples/bookinfo/) sample as the example application.

To learn how Istio handles tracing, visit this task's [overview](../overview/).

## Before you begin

1.  Follow the [Zipkin installation](/docs/ops/integrations/zipkin/#installation) documentation to deploy Zipkin into your cluster.

1.  When you enable tracing, you can set the sampling rate that Istio uses for tracing. Use the `values.pilot.traceSampling` option during installation to set the sampling rate. The default sampling rate is 1%.

1.  Deploy the [Bookinfo](/docs/examples/bookinfo/#deploying-the-application) sample application.

## Accessing the dashboard

[Remotely Accessing Telemetry Addons](/docs/tasks/observability/gateways) details how to configure access to the Istio addons through a gateway.

For testing (and temporary access), you may also use port-forwarding. Use the following, assuming you've deployed Zipkin to the `istio-system` namespace:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl dashboard zipkin
{{< /text >}}

## Generating traces using the Bookinfo sample

1.  When the Bookinfo application is up and running, access `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage` one or more times
    to generate trace information.

    {{< boilerplate trace-generation >}}

1.  From the top panel, select a service of interest (or 'all') from the **Service Name** drop-down list and click
    **Find Traces**:

1.  Click on the most recent trace at the top to see the details corresponding to the
    latest request to the `/productpage`:

    {{< image link="./istio-tracing-details-zipkin.png" caption="Detailed Trace View" >}}

1.  The trace is comprised of a set of spans,
    where each span corresponds to a Bookinfo service, invoked during the execution of a `/productpage` request, or
    internal Istio component, for example: `istio-ingressgateway`.

## Cleanup

1.  Remove any `istioctl` processes that may still be running using control-C or:

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ killall istioctl
    {{< /text >}}

1.  If you are not planning to explore any follow-on tasks, refer to the
    [Bookinfo cleanup](/docs/examples/bookinfo/#cleanup) instructions
    to shutdown the application.
