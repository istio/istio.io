Follow this guide to upgrade and configure an ambient mode installation using
[Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/). This guide assumes you have already performed an [ambient mode installation with Helm](/docs/ambient/install/helm-installation/) with a previous version of Istio.

{{< warning >}}
In contrast to sidecar mode, ambient mode supports moving application pods to an upgraded data plane without a mandatory restart or reschedule of running application pods. However, upgrading the ztunnel **will** briefly disrupt all workload traffic on the upgraded node, and ambient mode does not currently support canary upgrades of the ztunnel.

Node cordoning and blue/green node pools are recommended to control blast radius of application pod traffic disruption during production upgrades. See your Kubernetes provider documentation for details.

## Understanding Ambient Upgrades

All Istio Upgrades involve upgrading the control plane, data plane, and Istio CRDs. Because the Ambient Data Plane is separated into [two components](/docs/ambient/architecture/data-plane), the ztunnel and waypoints, Ambient Upgrades involve separate steps for these components. Upgrading the control plane and CRDs will be covered here in brief, but is essentially identical to the process for these components in sidecar mode, which is covered extensively [here](docs/setup/upgrade/canary/).

Like sidecar mode, ambient mode upgrades make use of Tags and Revisions to allow fine-grained control over ({{< gloss >}}gateway{{</ gloss >}}) upgrades, including ({{< gloss >}}waypoints{{</ gloss >}}), with simple controls for rolling back at any point. However, unlike sidecar mode, the Ambient ztunnel runs as a DaemonSet, or per-node proxy, meaning that ztunnel upgrades affect, at minimum, one entire node at a time. For this reason, we recommend using Node cordoning and draining before upgrading the ztunnel component for a given node. For the sake of simplicity, this document will demonstrate in-place upgrades of the ztunnel, which are less safe, and may involve some downtime.

With that in mind, this guide will expand on the following steps to upgrade Istio in ambient mode:

1. Prerequisites
1. Upgrade the CRDs
1. Install the New Control Plane
1. Upgrade the ztunnel DaemonSet
1. Upgrade the CNI DaemonSet
1. Upgrade waypoints and gateways using tags
1. Uninstall the old Control Plane

## Prerequisites

1. Organize your Tags and Revisions

    In order to safely upgrade Ambient, your Waypoints, Gateways, and Namespaces should be using the istio.io/rev label to specify an Istio Tag which will control the version of the Istio Proxy that is running. We recommend dividing your production cluster into multiple tags to organize your upgrade. All members of a given tag will be upgraded simultaneously, so it is wise to begin your upgrade with your lowest risk applications. We do not recommend referencing revisions directly via labels for upgrades, as this process can easily result in the accidental upgrade of a large number of proxies, and is difficult to segment. To see what tags and revisions you are using in your cluster, see the section on upgrading tags.

1. Run the Precheck

    Before upgrading Istio, we recommend downloading the new version of istioctl, and running `istioctl x precheck` to make sure the upgrade is compatible with your environment. The output should looks something like this:

    {{< text syntax=bash snip_id=istioctl_precheck >}}
    $ istioctl x precheck
    âœ” No issues found when checking the cluster. Istio is safe to install or upgrade!
      To get started, check out <https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/>
    {{< /text >}}

1. Update the Helm repository:

    {{< text syntax=bash snip_id=update_helm >}}
    $ helm repo update istio
    {{< /text >}}

1. Choose a Revision Name
    Revisions identify unique instances of the Istio control plane, allowing you to run multiple distinct versions of the control plane simultaneously in a single mesh. It is recommended that revisions stay immutable, that is, that once a control plane is installed with a particular revision name, that installation not be modified, and that revision name not be reused. Tags, on the other hand, are mutable pointers to revisions. This enables a cluster operator to effect data plane upgrades without the need to adjust any workload labels, simply by moving a tag from one revision to the next. All data planes will connect only to one control plane, specified by the istio.io/rev label (pointing to either a revision or tag), or by the default revision if no istio.io/rev label is present. Upgrading a data plane consists of simply changing the control plane it is pointed to via modifying labels or editing tags.

    Because Revisions are intended to be immutable, we recommend choosing a revision name that corresponds with the version of Istio you are installing, such as `1-22-1`. In addition to choosing a new revision name, you should note your current revision name. You can find this by running

    {{< text syntax=bash snip_id=list_revisions >}}
    $ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations -l 'istio.io/rev,!istio.io/tag' -L istio\.io/rev
    $ # Store your revision and new revision in variables:
    $ export REVISION=istio-1-22-1
    $ export OLD_REVISION=istio-1-21-2
    {{< /text >}}

## Upgrade the Kubernetes custom resource definitions ({{< gloss >}}CRDs{{</ gloss >}})

    {{< text bash >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f manifests/charts/base/crds
    {{< /text >}}

## Install the New Control Plane

Istiod is the control plane component that manages and configures the proxies to route traffic within an ambient mesh. The following command will install a new instance of this control plane alongside the old, but will not introduce any new proxies, or take over control for existing proxies. If you have previously customized your istiod installation, you can reuse the `values.yaml` file from previous upgrades or installs to keep your control planes consistent.

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_istiod >}}
$ helm install istiod-"$REVISION" istio/istiod -n istio-system --set revision="$REVISION" --set profile=ambient --wait
{{< /text >}}

## Upgrade the ztunnel DaemonSet

The {{< gloss >}}ztunnel{{< /gloss >}} DaemonSet is the node proxy component. The ztunnel at version 1.x is compatible with the control plane at version 1.x+1 and 1.x. This means the control plane must be upgraded before ztunnel, as long as their version difference is within one minor version. If you have previously customized your ztunnel installation, you can reuse the `values.yaml` file from previous upgrades or installs to keep your {{< gloss >}}data plane{{< /gloss >}} consistent.

{{< warning >}}
Upgrading ztunnel in-place will briefly disrupt all ambient mesh traffic on the node.
Node cordoning and blue/green node pools are recommended to mitigate blast radius risk during production upgrades. See your Kubernetes provider documentation for details.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_ztunnel >}}
$ helm upgrade ztunnel istio/ztunnel -n istio-system --set revision="$REVISION" --wait
{{< /text >}}

## Upgrade the CNI DaemonSet

The Istio CNI agent is responsible for detecting pods added to the ambient mesh, informing ztunnel that proxy ports should be established within added pods, and configuring traffic redirection within the pod network namespace. It is not part of the data plane or control plane.

The CNI at version 1.x is  compatible with the control plane at version 1.x+1 and 1.x. This means the control plane must be upgraded before Istio CNI, as long as their version difference is within one minor version.

{{< warning >}}
Upgrading the Istio CNI agent to a compatible version in-place will not disrupt networking for running pods already successfully added to an ambient mesh, but no ambient-captured pods will be successfully scheduled (or rescheduled) on the node until the upgrade is complete and the upgraded Istio CNI agent on the node passes readiness checks. If this is a significant disruption concern, or stricter blast radius controls are desired for CNI upgrades, node taints and/or node cordons are recommended.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_cni >}}
$ helm upgrade istio-cni istio/cni -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}

## Upgrade waypoints and gateways using tags

If you have followed best practices, all of your gateway, workload, and namespaces use either the default revision (which is effectively a tag named default), or the `istio.io/rev` label with the value set to a tag name. We will now upgrade all of these data planes to the new version of Istio by moving their tags to point to the new version, one at a time. To list all tags in your cluster, run:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=list_tags >}}
$ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations -l 'istio.io/tag' -L istio\.io/tag,istio\.io/rev
{{< /text >}}

For each tag, you can upgrade the tag by running the following command, replacing `$MYTAG` with your tag name, and `$REVISION` with your revision name:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_tag >}}
$ helm template istiod istio/istiod -s templates/revision-tags.yaml --set revisionTags="{$MYTAG}" --set revision="$REVISION" -n istio-system | kubectl apply -f -
{{< /text >}}

This will upgrade all dataplanes referencing that tag, except for networking.istio.io gateways, which are dealt with below, and sidecars, which are not used in Ambient mode. It is recommended that you closely monitor the health of applications using the upgraded dataplane before upgrading the next tag. If you detect a problem, you can rollback a tag, resetting it to point to the name of your old revision:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=rollback_tag >}}
$ helm template istiod istio/istiod -s templates/revision-tags.yaml --set revisionTags="{$MYTAG}" --set revision="$OLD_REVISION" -n istio-system | kubectl apply -f -
{{< /text >}}

### Upgrade the Gateway component (optional)

Gateway components using the `networking.istio.io/*/Gateway` types must be upgraded individually using helm.

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_gateway >}}
$ helm upgrade istio-ingress istio/gateway -n istio-ingress
{{< /text >}}

## Uninstall the previous control plane

If you have upgraded all dataplane components to use the new version of Istio, and are satisfied that you do not need to rollback, you can remove the previous version of the control plane by running:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=none >}}
$ helm delete istiod-"$REVISION" -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}
