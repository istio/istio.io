Adding applications to an ambient mesh is as simple as labeling the namespace where the application resides. By adding the applications to the mesh, you automatically secure the communication between them and Istio starts gathering TCP telemetry. And no, you don't need to restart or redeploy the applications!

## Add Bookinfo to the mesh

You can enable all pods in a given namespace to be part of an ambient mesh by simply labeling the namespace:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl label namespace default istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient
namespace/default labeled
{{< /text >}}

Congratulations! You have successfully added all pods in the default namespace to the ambient mesh. ðŸŽ‰

If you open the Bookinfo application in your browser, you will see the product page, just like before. The difference this time is that the communication between the Bookinfo application pods is encrypted using mTLS. Additionally, Istio is gathering TCP telemetry for all traffic between the pods.

{{< tip >}}
You now have mTLS encryption between all your pods â€” without even restarting or redeploying any of the applications!
{{< /tip >}}

You can run the following command to verify that all pods are running and they haven't been restarted:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=none >}}
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
details-v1-cf74bb974-nw94k       1/1     Running   0          4m42s
productpage-v1-87d54dd59-wl7qf   1/1     Running   0          4m42s
ratings-v1-7c4bbf97db-rwkw5      1/1     Running   0          4m42s
reviews-v1-5fd6d4f8f8-66j45      1/1     Running   0          4m42s
reviews-v2-6f9b55c5db-6ts96      1/1     Running   0          4m42s
reviews-v3-7d99fd7978-dm6mx      1/1     Running   0          4m42s
{{< /text >}}

Note the `RESTARTS` column. If the value is `0`, it means that the pods haven't been restarted.

## Visualize the application and metrics

Using Istio's dashboard, Kiali, and the Prometheus metrics engine, you can visualize the Bookinfo application. Deploy them both:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=none >}}
$ kubectl apply -f {{< github_file >}}/samples/addons/prometheus.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f {{< github_file >}}/samples/addons/kiali.yaml
{{< /text >}}

You can access the Kiali dashboard by running the following command:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=none >}}
$ istioctl dashboard kiali
{{< /text >}}

Click on the Traffic Graph and you should see the Bookinfo application:

{{< image link="./kiali-ambient-bookinfo.png" caption="Kiali dashboard" >}}

{{< tip >}}
If you don't see any traffic in Kiali, try refreshing the Bookinfo application in your browser a few times. This will generate some traffic, which you should see in Kiali soon.
{{</ tip >}}

If you click on one of the services on the the dashboard, you can see the inbound and outbound traffic metrics gathered by Istio:

{{< image link="./kiali-tcp-traffic.png" caption="L4 traffic" >}}

In addition to securing your traffic with mTLS and providing telemetry, Istio has created a strong identity for each service (a SPIFFE ID). This identity can be used for creating authorization policies.

## Next steps

Now that we have identities assigned to the services, let's [enforce authorization policies](/docs/ambient/getting-started/enforce-auth-policies/) to secure access to the application.
