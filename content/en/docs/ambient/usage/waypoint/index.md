A **waypoint proxy** is an optional deployment of the Envoy-based proxy to add Layer 7 (L7) processing to a defined set of workloads.

Waypoint proxies are installed, upgraded and scaled independently from applications; an application owner should be unaware of their existence. Compared to the sidecar {{< gloss >}}data plane{{< /gloss >}} mode, which runs an instance of the Envoy proxy alongside each workload, the number of proxies required can be substantially reduced.

A waypoint, or set of waypoints, can be shared between applications with a similar security boundary. This might be all the instances of a particular workload, or all the workloads in a namespace.

As opposed to {{< gloss >}}sidecar{{< /gloss >}} mode, in ambient mode policies are enforced by the **destination** waypoint. In many ways, the waypoint acts as a gateway to a resource (a namespace, service or pod). Istio enforces that all traffic coming into the resource goes through the waypoint, which then enforces all policies for that resource.

## Do you need a waypoint proxy?

The layered approach of ambient allows users to adopt Istio in a more incremental fashion, smoothly transitioning from no mesh, to the secure L4 overlay, to full L7 processing.

Most of the features of ambient mode are provided by the ztunnel node proxy. Ztunnel is scoped to only process traffic at Layer 4 (L4), so that it can safely operate as a shared component.

When you configure redirection to a waypoint, traffic will be forwarded by ztunnel to that waypoint. If your applications require any of the following L7 mesh functions, you will need to use a waypoint proxy:

* **Traffic management**: HTTP routing & load balancing, circuit breaking, rate limiting, fault injection, retries, timeouts
* **Security**: Rich authorization policies based on L7 primitives such as request type or HTTP header
* **Observability**: HTTP metrics, access logging, tracing

## Deploy a waypoint proxy

Waypoint proxies are deployed declaratively using Kubernetes Gateway resources. You can use istioctl experimental subcommands to generate, apply or list these resources.

After the waypoint is deployed, the entire namespace (or whichever services or pods you choose) must be [enrolled](#useawaypoint) to use it.

Before you deploy a waypoint proxy for a specific namespace, confirm the namespace is labeled with `istio.io/dataplane-mode: ambient`:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl get ns -L istio.io/dataplane-mode
NAME              STATUS   AGE   DATAPLANE-MODE
istio-system      Active   24h
default           Active   24h   ambient
{{< /text >}}

`istioctl` can generate a Kubernetes Gateway resource for a waypoint proxy. For example, to generate a waypoint proxy named `waypoint` for the `default` namespace that can process traffic for services in the namespace:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl experimental waypoint generate --for service -n default
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  labels:
    istio.io/waypoint-for: service
  name: waypoint
  namespace: default
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
{{< /text >}}

Note the Gateway resource has the `istio-waypoint` label set to `gatewayClassName` which indicates it is a waypoint provided by Istio. The Gateway resource is labeled with `istio.io/waypoint-for: service`, indicating the waypoint can process traffic for services, which is the default.

To deploy a waypoint proxy directly, use `apply` instead of `generate`:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl experimental waypoint apply -n default
waypoint default/namespace applied
{{< /text >}}

Or, you can deploy the generated Gateway resource:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  labels:
    istio.io/waypoint-for: service
  name: waypoint
  namespace: default
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
EOF
{{< /text >}}

After the Gateway resource is applied, Istiod will monitor the resource, deploy and manage the corresponding waypoint deployment and service for users automatically.

### Waypoint traffic types

By default, a waypoint will only handle traffic destined for **services** in its namespaces. This choice was made because traffic directed at a pod alone is rare, and often used for internal purposes such as Prometheus scraping, and the extra overhead of L7 processing may not be desired.

It is also possible for the waypoint to handle all traffic, only handle traffic sent directly to **workloads** (pods or VMs) in the cluster, or no traffic at all. The types of traffic that will be redirected to the waypoint are determined by the `istio.io/waypoint-for` label on the `Gateway` object.

The `--for` parameter to `istioctl experimental waypoint apply` can be used to change the [traffic type](#waypoint-traffic-types) redirected to the waypoint:

| `waypoint-for` value | Traffic type |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| `service`            | Kubernetes services |
| `workload`           | Pod or VM IPs |
| `all`                | Both service and workload traffic |
| `none`               | No traffic (useful for testing) |

## Use a waypoint proxy {#useawaypoint}

When a waypoint proxy is deployed, it is not used by any resources until you explicitly configure those resources to use it.

To enable a namespace, service or Pod to use a waypoint, add the `istio.io/use-waypoint` label with a value of the waypoint name.

{{< tip >}}
Most users will want to apply a waypoint to an entire namespace, and we recommend you start with this approach.
{{< /tip >}}

If you use `istioctl` to deploy your namespace waypoint, you can use the `--enroll-namespace` parameter to automatically label a namespace:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl experimental waypoint apply -n default --enroll-namespace
waypoint default/waypoint applied
namespace default labeled with "istio.io/use-waypoint: waypoint"
{{< /text >}}

Alternatively, you may add the `istio.io/use-waypoint: waypoint` label to the `default` namespace using `kubectl`:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl label ns default istio.io/use-waypoint=waypoint
namespace/default labeled
{{< /text >}}

After a namespace is enrolled to use a waypoint, any requests from any pods using the ambient data plane mode, to any service running in that namespace, will be routed through the waypoint for L7 processing and policy enforcement.

If you prefer more granularity than using a waypoint for an entire namespace, you can enroll only a specific service or pod to use a waypoint. This may be useful if you only need L7 features for some services in a namespace, if you only want an extension like a `WasmPlugin` to apply to a specific service, or if you are calling a Kubernetes
[headless service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) by its pod IP address.

{{< tip >}}
If the `istio.io/use-waypoint` label exists on both a namespace and a service, the service waypoint takes precedence over the namespace waypoint as long as the service waypoint can handle `service` or `all` traffic. Similarly, a label on a pod will take precedence over a namespace label.
{{< /tip >}}

### Configure a service to use a specific waypoint

Using the services from the sample [bookinfo application](/docs/examples/bookinfo/), we can deploy a waypoint called `reviews-svc-waypoint` for the `reviews` service:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl experimental waypoint apply -n default --name reviews-svc-waypoint
waypoint default/reviews-svc-waypoint applied
{{< /text >}}

Label the `reviews` service to use the `reviews-svc-waypoint` waypoint:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl label service reviews istio.io/use-waypoint=reviews-svc-waypoint
service/reviews labeled
{{< /text >}}

Any requests from pods in the mesh to the `reviews` service will now be routed through the `reviews-svc-waypoint` waypoint.

### Configure a pod to use a specific waypoint

Deploy a waypoint called `reviews-v2-pod-waypoint` for the `reviews-v2` pod.

{{< tip >}}
Recall the default for waypoints is to target services; as we explicitly want to target a pod, we need to use the `istio.io/waypoint-for: workload` label, which we can generate by using the `--for workload` parameter to istioctl.
{{< /tip >}}

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl experimental waypoint apply -n default --name reviews-v2-pod-waypoint --for workload
waypoint default/reviews-v2-pod-waypoint applied
{{< /text >}}

Label the `reviews-v2` pod to use the `reviews-v2-pod-waypoint` waypoint:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl label pod -l version=v2,app=reviews istio.io/use-waypoint=reviews-v2-pod-waypoint
pod/reviews-v2-5b667bcbf8-spnnh labeled
{{< /text >}}

Any requests from pods in the ambient mesh to the `reviews-v2` pod IP will now be routed through the `reviews-v2-pod-waypoint` waypoint for L7 processing and policy enforcement.
