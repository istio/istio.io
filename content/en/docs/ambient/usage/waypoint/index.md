Ambient splits Istioâ€™s functionality into two distinct layers, a secure overlay layer and a Layer 7 processing layer.
The waypoint proxy is an optional component that is Envoy-based and handles L7 processing for different resources.
What is unique about the waypoint proxy is that it runs outside of the application pod. A waypoint proxy can install,
upgrade, and scale independently from the application, as well as reduce operational costs. When deploying a waypoint,
you can configure the waypoint to process traffic for different resource types such as `service` or `workload` or `all`.

## Do you need a waypoint proxy?

This layered approach of ambient allows users to adopt Istio in a more incremental fashion, smoothly transitioning from no mesh, to the secure overlay, to full L7 processing. If your applications require any of the following L7 mesh functions, you will need to use waypoint proxy for your applications:

## Deploy a waypoint proxy

Waypoint proxies are deployed declaratively using Kubernetes Gateway resources or the helpful istioctl command. You can preview the generated Kubernetes Gateway resource:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl x waypoint generate -n default
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  labels:
    istio.io/waypoint-for: service
  name: waypoint
  namespace: default
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
{{< /text >}}

Use the command below to deploy a waypoint proxy for the `default` namespace:

{{< text bash >}}
$ istioctl x waypoint apply -n default
{{< /text >}}

Or, you can deploy the generated Gateway resource to your Kubernetes cluster:

{{< text bash >}}
$ kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  labels:
    istio.io/waypoint-for: service
  name: waypoint
  namespace: default
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
EOF
{{< /text >}}

Istiod will monitor these resources, deploy and manage the corresponding waypoint deployment for users automatically.

## Use a waypoint proxy

By default, waypoint proxy can be used for any services for the namespace where the waypoint proxy runs.

## Attach L7 policies to the waypoint proxy


## Debug your waypoint proxy
