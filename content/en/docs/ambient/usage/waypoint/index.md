Ambient splits Istioâ€™s functionality into two distinct layers, a secure overlay layer and a Layer 7 processing layer.
The waypoint proxy is an optional component that is Envoy-based and handles L7 processing for different resources.
What is unique about the waypoint proxy is that it runs outside of the application pod. A waypoint proxy can install,
upgrade, and scale independently from the application, as well as reduce operational costs. When deploying a waypoint,
you can configure the waypoint to process traffic for different resource types such as `service` or `workload` or `all`.
