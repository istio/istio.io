title: Pod
---
A Pod is a group of one or more containers (such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers),
with shared storage and network, and a specification for how to run the containers.
Pods are the [workload instances](/docs/reference/glossary/#workload-instance) in a
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/) deployment of Istio.
