Proxyless refers to a [data plane mode](/docs/reference/glossary/#data-plane-mode) that runs without proxies by instead
moving mesh functionality directly into applications.
Currently, Istio supports a [Proxyless gRPC](/blog/2021/proxyless-grpc/) mode,
which enables mesh functionality in the [gRPC framework](https://grpc.io/).
