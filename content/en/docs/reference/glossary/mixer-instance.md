title: Mixer Instance
test: n/a
---

An instance represents a chunk of Mixer data that is produced by inspecting a set of request [attributes](/docs/reference/glossary/#attribute) and applying the operator-supplied configuration.
Instances are delivered to individual [handlers](/docs/reference/glossary/#mixer-handler), on their way to
infrastructure backends.
