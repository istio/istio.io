The data plane mode refers to which deployment mode the [data plane](/docs/reference/glossary/#data-plane) is using.
Istio currently supports three modes: [sidecar](/docs/reference/glossary/#sidecar), [ambient](/docs/reference/glossary/#ambient), and [proxyless](/docs/reference/glossary/#proxyless).
