A gateway is a standalone Istio proxy deployed at the edge of the mesh.
Gateways are used to route traffic [into](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/) or [out of](/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress/) the mesh.

An Istio `Gateway` CR is used to configure the exposed ports of a gateway deployment.
