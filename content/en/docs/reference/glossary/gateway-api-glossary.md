### Gateway

A Gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh, handling incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. It configures a set of listeners for inbound or outbound traffic.

### HTTPRoute

An HTTPRoute defines how HTTP traffic should be routed. It includes rules for matching requests and forwarding them to specific services.

### TCPRoute

Similar to HTTPRoute, but for TCP traffic. It defines rules for matching TCP connections and forwarding them.

### parentRefs

This field specifies the parent resources that a route is attached to. For example, an HTTPRoute might specify a Gateway as its parent.

### targetRefs

This field specifies the target resources that a route should forward traffic to. For example, an HTTPRoute might specify a Kubernetes Service as its target.
