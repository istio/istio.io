A remote cluster is a [cluster](/docs/reference/glossary/#cluster) that
connects to a [control plane](/docs/reference/glossary/#control-plane)
residing outside of the cluster. A remote cluster can connect to a control plane
running in a [primary cluster](/docs/reference/glossary/#primary-cluster)
or to an [external control plane](/docs/reference/glossary/#external-control-plane).
