title: Trust Domain
---

An identity contains a substring identifying the mesh that created it. For
example in `spiffe://mytrustdomain.com/ns/default/sa/myname` the substring
identifying the mesh is: `mytrustdomain.com`. We call this substring the trust
domain of the mesh. Every Istio mesh has a globally unique trust domain used to
create identity names.
