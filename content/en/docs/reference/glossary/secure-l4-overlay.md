The term "secure overlay" or "secure L4 overlay" is used to collectively describe the set of L4 networking functions implemented in an ambient mesh via the ztunnel proxy. At the transport layer, this is implemented via an HTTP CONNECT-based traffic tunneling protocol called [HBONE](/docs/reference/glossary/#hbone).
