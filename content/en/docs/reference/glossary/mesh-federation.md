title: Mesh Federation
---

Mesh federation is the act of exposing services between meshes and enabling
communication across mesh boundaries. Each mesh may expose a subset of its
services to enable one or more other meshes to consume the exposed services. You
can use mesh federation to enable communication between meshes in a
[multi-mesh deployment](/docs/ops/prep/deployment-models/#multiple-meshes).
