A delineated group of related behaviors within a [service mesh](/docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh). Services are identified using a
[service name](/docs/reference/glossary/#service-name),
and Istio policies such as load balancing and routing are applied using these names.
A service is typically materialized by one or more [service endpoints](/docs/reference/glossary/#service-endpoint), and may consist of multiple
[service versions](/docs/reference/glossary/#service-version).
