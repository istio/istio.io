The downstream client of the [Envoy](/docs/reference/glossary/#envoy) proxy.
Within the [service mesh](/docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh) a source is typically a
[workload](/docs/reference/glossary/#workload), but the source for ingress traffic may include other clients such as a
browser or mobile app.
