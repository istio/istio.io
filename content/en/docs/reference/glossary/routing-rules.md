title: Routing Rules
---
Routing rules, which you configure in a [virtual service](#virtual-service), define the paths that
requests follow within the service mesh. With routing rules, you can define
conditions to route traffic addressed to the [virtual service](#virtual-service)'s host to specific
destination workloads. Routing rules let you set up complex
[traffic routing](/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#virtual-services)
scenarios.
