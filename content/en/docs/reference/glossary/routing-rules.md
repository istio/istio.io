title: Routing Rules
---
Routing rules, which you configure in a virtual service, define the paths that
requests follow within the service mesh. With routing rules, you can define
conditions to route traffic addressed to the virtual service's host to specific
destination workloads. Routing rules let you set up complex
[traffic routing](/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#traffic-routing-and-configuration)
scenarios.
