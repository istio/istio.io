title: Virtual Service
---
A virtual service is a resource you can use to configure how Envoy proxies route
requests to a service within an Istio service mesh. The routing rules that you
define in a virtual service let you set up complex
[traffic routing](/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#virtual-services)
scenarios.
