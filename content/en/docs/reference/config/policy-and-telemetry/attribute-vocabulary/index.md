Attributes are a central concept used throughout Istio. You can find a description of what attributes are
and what they are used for [here](/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/mixer-overview/#attributes).

A given Istio deployment has a fixed vocabulary of attributes that it understands. The specific vocabulary is
determined by the set of attribute producers being used in the deployment. The primary attribute producer in Istio
is Envoy, although Mixer and services can also introduce attributes.

The table below shows the set of canonical attributes and their respective types. Most Istio
deployments will have agents (Envoy or Mixer adapters) that produce these attributes.

## Timestamp and duration attributes format

Timestamp attributes are represented in the RFC 3339 format. When operating with timestamp attributes, you can use the `timestamp` function defined in [CEXL](/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/expression-language/) to convert a textual timestamp in RFC 3339 format into the `TIMESTAMP` type, for example: `request.time | timestamp("2018-01-01T22:08:41+00:00")`, `response.time > timestamp("2020-02-29T00:00:00-08:00")`.

Duration attributes represent an amount of time, expressed as a series of decimal numbers with an optional fractional part denoted with a period, and a unit value. The possible unit values are `ns` for nanoseconds, `us` (or `¬µs`) for microseconds, `ms` for milliseconds, `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours. For example:

* `1ms` represents 1 millisecond
* `2.3s` represents 2.3 seconds
* `4m` represents 4 minutes
* `5h10m` represents 5 hours and 10 minutes
