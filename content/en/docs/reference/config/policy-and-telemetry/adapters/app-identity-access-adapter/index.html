<p>With the App Identity and Access Istio adapter, you can use any OIDC compliant identity provider, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/app-id">IBM Cloud App ID</a>, to
protect your APIs and containerized web apps. Without any change to your code or the need to redeploy
your app, you can enforce authentication and authorization policies in all of your environments.
To get started with sample configurations see the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-istio-adapter">docs</a>.</p>
