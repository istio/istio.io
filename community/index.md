# Our community

Istio is an open source project with an active community that supports its use and on-going development. We'd love for you
to join us and get involved!

There are quite a few ways to get plugged in with the Istio community. See below to learn the
best approach for different cases. See [here]({{home}}/bugs/) if you're trying to figure out how to report
bugs.
