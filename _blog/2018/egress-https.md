In many cases, not all the parts of a microservices-based application reside in a Service Mesh. Sometimes, the microservices-based applications use functionality provided by legacy systems that reside outside of the Mesh. In other cases, the applications use web services provided by external organizations, often over the World Wide Web.

In this blog post I will modify [Istio Bookinfo Sample Application]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html) to fetch book details from an external web service ([Google Books APIs](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)). I will show how to enable external HTTPS traffic in Istio by using an Egress Rule. I will explain the current issues related to the Egress Traffic control in Istio.

## Bookinfo Sample App with External Details Web Service

### Initial Setting
To demonstrate the scenario of consuming an external web service, I will start with a Kubernetes cluster that has [Istio installed]({{home}}/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html#installation-steps). Then I will deploy [Istio Bookinfo Sample Application]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html). This application uses the _details_ microservice to fetch book details, e.g. the number of pages and the publisher. The original _details_ microservice provides the book details without consulting any external service.

I will copy here the end-to-end architecture of the application from the original [Bookinfo Guide]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html).

### Bookinfo with Details Version 2
Let's add a new version of the _details_ microservice, _v2_, that fetches the book details from [Google Books APIs](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started).

I am using a cluster with
[automatic sidecar injection]({{home}}/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection.html#automatic-sidecar-injection)
   enabled, so I will simply use `kubectl` command to deploy _details v2_.
```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/kube/bookinfo-details-v2.yaml
```

The updated architecture of the application now looks as follows:
<figure><img src="img/bookinfo-details-v2.svg" alt="The BookInfo Application with details v2" title="The BookInfo Application with details v2" />
<figcaption>The BookInfo Application with details v2</figcaption></figure>

Note that the Google Books web service is outside of the Istio Service Mesh whose boundaries are marked by a dashed line.

Now let's direct all the traffic to the version _v2_ of the _details_ microservice, using the following route rule:

```bash
cat <<EOF | istioctl create -f -
apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
kind: RouteRule
metadata:
  name: details-v2
  namespace: default
spec:
  destination:
    name: details
  route:
  - labels:
      version: v2
EOF
```

Let's access the web page of the application, after [determining the ingress IP and Port]({{home}}/docs/guides/bookinfo.html#determining-the-ingress-ip-and-port).

Oops... Instead of the book details we have _Error fetching product details_ message displayed:
<figure><img src="img/errorFetchingBookDetails.png" alt="Error Fetching Product Details" title="Error Fetching Product Details" />
<figcaption>Error Fetching Product Details Displayed</figcaption></figure>


Good news is that our app did not crash. As in a good microservice design, we do not have error propagation, that is, the failing _details_ microservice does not cause the _productpage_ microservice to fail. Most of the functionality of the application is still provided, in this case the reviews and the ratings are displayed correctly.

Hmm, so what could have gone wrong? Ah... The answer is that I forgot to enable traffic from inside the mesh to an external service, in this case to the Google Books web service. By default, the Istio sidecar proxies block all the traffic to the outside of the cluster. To enable such traffic, we have to define an [Egress Rule]({{home}}/reference/config/traffic-rules/egress-rules.html).

### Egress Rule for Google Books Web Service
No worries, let's define an Egress Rule and fix our application.
```bash
cat <<EOF | istioctl create -f -
apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
kind: EgressRule
metadata:
  name: googleapis
  namespace: default
spec:
  destination:
      service: "*.googleapis.com"
  ports:
      - port: 443
        protocol: https
EOF
```

Now accessing the web page of the application displays the book details without error:

<figure><img src="img/externalBookDetails.png" alt="Book Details displayed without error" title="Book Details displayed without error" />
<figcaption>Book Details displayed without error</figcaption></figure>

Note that our Egress Rule allows traffic to any domain matching _*.googleapis.com_, on port 443, using the HTTPS protocol. Let's assume for the sake of the example, that we must access multiple domains matching _*.gooogleapis.com_, not only _www.googleapis.com_ which is accessed by our code in reality. This wildcard feature allows us to enable traffic to multiple domains by a single Egress Rule.


We can query our Egress Rules:
```bash
istioctl get egressrules
```

and see our new Egress Rule in the output:
```bash
NAME		KIND					NAMESPACE
googleapis	EgressRule.v1alpha2.config.istio.io	default
```

We can delete our Egress Rule:
```bash
istioctl delete egressrule googleapis -n default
```

and see in the output of _istioctl delete_ that the Egress Rule is deleted:
```
Deleted config: egressrule googleapis
```

Now, accessing the web page will produce the same error about fetching product details we experienced before. As we can see, the Egress Rules are defined dynamically. The Istio Operators can decide dynamically which domains they allow the microservices to access. They can enable and disable traffic to the external domains dynamically.

## The Issues with Istio Egress Traffic Control
### TLS Origination by Istio
There is a caveat to the story. In HTTPS, all the HTTP details (hostname, path, headers etc.) are encrypted, so Istio cannot know the destination domain of the encrypted requests. Well, Istio could know the destination domain by the  [SNI](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3546#section-3.1) (_Server Name Indication_) field. This feature is not yet implemented in Istio. Therefore Istio cannot perform filtering of HTTPS requests based on the destination domains.

To allow Istio perform filtering of Egress Requests based on domains, the microservices must issue HTTP requests. Istio then will open HTTPS connection to the destination (perform TLS origination). The microservices code must be written or configured differently depending on whether the microservice runs inside or outside of an Istio Service Mesh. This contradicts the Istio Design Goal of [Maximizing Transparency]({{home}}/concepts/what-is-istio/goals.html). Tough luck, sometimes we must compromise...

Here how it is done in the [the Bookinfo details microservice code](https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/samples/bookinfo/src/details/details.rb), using Ruby [net/http module](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Net/HTTP.html):
```ruby
uri = URI.parse('https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:' + isbn)
http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
...
unless ENV['WITH_ISTIO'] === 'true' then
     http.use_ssl = true
end
```

When `WITH_ISTIO` environment variable is defined, the request is performed without SSL (plain HTTP).

We set `WITH_ISTIO` environment variable to "true" string in the [kubernetes deployment of _details v2_](https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/samples/bookinfo/kube/bookinfo-details-v2.yaml), container spec:
```yaml
env:
- name: WITH_ISTIO
  value: "true"
```

### Malicious Microservices Threat
Another issue is that the Egress Rule is currently **not a security feature**, it just **enables** traffic to external services. For HTTP based protocols, the rules are based on domains. Istio does not check that the IP of the request matches the _Host_ header. It means that a malicious microservice inside a Service Mesh could trick Istio to allow traffic to a malicious IP, while setting an allowed domain as the _Host_ header.

Securing egress traffic is currently not supported in Istio and should be performed elsewhere, for example by a firewall or by an additional proxy outside of Istio. Right now we in Istio are working to add applying Mixer security policies on the egress traffic and to secure the Egress Rules to prevent the attack described above.

### No Tracing, Telemetry and no Mixer Checks
Note that currently no tracing/telemetry information can be collected for the Egress traffic and Mixer policies cannot be applied. We are working to fix this in the future Istio releases.

## Future Work
In my next blog posts I will demonstrate Istio Egress Rules for TCP traffic and will show examples of combining Routing Rules and Egress Rules.

In Istio, we are working on making Istio egress traffic more secure, and in particular on enabling tracing/telemetry and Mixer checkss.

## Conclusion
In this blog post I demonstrated how the microservices in an Istio Service Mesh can consume external web services via HTTPS. By default, Istio blocks all the traffic to the hosts outside of the cluster. To enable such traffic, Egress Rules must be created for the Service Mesh. It is possible to access the external sites by HTTPS, however the microservices must issue HTTP requests while Istio will communicate to the external sites by HTTPS (TLS origination). Currently, no logging, telemetry and Mixer checks are enabled on the egress traffic. Egress Rules are currently not a security feature, so additional mechanisms are required for securing egress traffic. We, in Istio, are working to make Egress Services more secure and to enable logging/telemetry and security policies on the egress traffic.
