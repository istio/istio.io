As enterprises migrate from traditional VM infrastructures to more agile
microservice-based deployments on container platforms, there is a need for
a simplifying technology that can take care of common cross-cutting
capabilities around service communication and management such as secure
interconnect, service discovery & load balancing, staged rollouts, A/B
testing, intelligent rate limiting, authentication, access control,
monitoring, logging, etc.

Towards this goal, we are designing Istio, an _open
platform-independent service mesh_ that takes care of traffic management,
policy enforcement, rate limiting, and telemetry collection.
It allows application developers to focus on the
business logic and iterate quickly on new features by managing how traffic
flows across their services. And it simplifies the operators' job of enforcing
various policies and monitor the mesh from a central control point,
independent of the evolution of the application ensuring continuous
compliance with policies of the organization/business unit.
