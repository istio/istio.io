## Overview

gRPC is designed to work with a variety of authentication mechanisms, making it
easy to safely use gRPC to talk to other systems. You can use our supported
mechanisms - SSL/TLS with or without Google token-based authentication - or you
can plug in your own authentication system by extending our provided code.

gRPC also provides a simple authentication API that lets you provide all the
necessary authentication information as `Credentials` when creating a channel or
making a call.

## Supported auth mechanisms

The following authentication mechanisms are built-in to gRPC:

   * **SSL/TLS**: gRPC has SSL/TLS integration and promotes the use of SSL/TLS
     to authenticate the server, and to encrypt all the data exchanged between
     the client and the server. Optional mechanisms are available for clients to
     provide certificates for mutual authentication.

   * **Token-based authentication with Google**: gRPC provides a generic
     mechanism (described below) to attach metadata based credentials to
     requests and responses. Additional support for acquiring access tokens
     (typically OAuth2 tokens) while accessing Google APIs through gRPC is
     provided for certain auth flows: you can see how this works in our code
     examples below. In general this mechanism must be used *as well as* SSL/TLS
     on the channel - Google will not allow connections without SSL/TLS, and
     most gRPC language implementations will not let you send credentials on an
     unencrypted channel.

     <p class="note"> <strong>WARNING</strong>: Google credentials should only
     be used to connect to Google services. Sending a Google issued OAuth2 token
     to a non-Google service could result in this token being stolen and used to
     impersonate the client to Google services.</p>

## Authentication API

gRPC provides a simple authentication API based around the unified concept of
Credentials objects, which can be used when creating an entire gRPC channel or
an individual call.

### Credential types

Credentials can be of two types:

- **Channel credentials**, which are attached to a `Channel`, such as SSL
  credentials.
- **Call credentials**, which are attached to a call (or `ClientContext` in
  C++).

You can also combine these in a`CompositeChannelCredentials`, allowing you to
specify, for example, SSL details for the channel along with call credentials
for each call made on the channel. A `CompositeChannelCredentials` associates a
`ChannelCredentials` and a `CallCredentials` to create a new
`ChannelCredentials`. The result will send the authentication data associated
with the composed `CallCredentials`with every call made on the channel.

For example, you could create a `ChannelCredentials` from an `SslCredentials`
and an `AccessTokenCredentials`. The result when applied to a `Channel` would
send the appropriate access token for each call on this channel.

Individual `CallCredentials` can also be composed using
`CompositeCallCredentials`. The resulting `CallCredentials` when used in a call
will trigger the sending of the authentication data associated with the two
`CallCredentials`.


### Using client-side SSL/TLS

Now let's look at how `Credentials` work with one of our supported auth
mechanisms. This is the simplest authentication scenario, where a client just
wants to authenticate the server and encrypt all data. The example is in C++,
but the API is similar for all languages: you can see how to enable SSL/TLS in
more languages in our Examples section below.

```cpp
// Create a default SSL ChannelCredentials object.
auto creds = grpc::SslCredentials(grpc::SslCredentialsOptions());
// Create a channel using the credentials created in the previous step.
auto channel = grpc::CreateChannel(server_name, creds);
// Create a stub on the channel.
std::unique_ptr<Greeter::Stub> stub(Greeter::NewStub(channel));
// Make actual RPC calls on the stub.
grpc::Status s = stub->sayHello(&context, *request, response);
```

For advanced use cases such as modifying the root CA or using client certs,
the corresponding options can be set in the `SslCredentialsOptions` parameter
passed to the factory method.


### Using Google token-based authentication

gRPC applications can use a simple API to create a credential that works for
authentication with Google in various deployment scenarios. Again, our example
is in C++ but you can find examples in other languages in our Examples section.

```cpp
auto creds = grpc::GoogleDefaultCredentials();
// Create a channel, stub and make RPC calls (same as in the previous example)
auto channel = grpc::CreateChannel(server_name, creds);
std::unique_ptr<Greeter::Stub> stub(Greeter::NewStub(channel));
grpc::Status s = stub->sayHello(&context, *request, response);
```

This channel credentials object works for applications using Service Accounts as
well as for applications running in [Google Compute Engine
(GCE)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/).  In the former case, the service
accountâ€™s private keys are loaded from the file named in the environment
variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. The keys are used to generate bearer
tokens that are attached to each outgoing RPC on the corresponding channel.

For applications running in GCE, a default service account and corresponding
OAuth2 scopes can be configured during VM setup. At run-time, this credential
handles communication with the authentication systems to obtain OAuth2 access
tokens and attaches them to each outgoing RPC on the corresponding channel.


### Extending gRPC to support other authentication mechanisms

The Credentials plugin API allows developers to plug in their own type of
credentials. This consists of:

- The `MetadataCredentialsPlugin` abstract class, which contains the pure virtual
  `GetMetadata` method that needs to be implemented by a sub-class created by
  the developer.
- The `MetadataCredentialsFromPlugin` function, which creates a `CallCredentials`
  from the `MetadataCredentialsPlugin`.

Here is example of a simple credentials plugin which sets an authentication
ticket in a custom header.

```cpp
class MyCustomAuthenticator : public grpc::MetadataCredentialsPlugin {
 public:
  MyCustomAuthenticator(const grpc::string& ticket) : ticket_(ticket) {}

  grpc::Status GetMetadata(
      grpc::string_ref service_url, grpc::string_ref method_name,
      const grpc::AuthContext& channel_auth_context,
      std::multimap<grpc::string, grpc::string>* metadata) override {
    metadata->insert(std::make_pair("x-custom-auth-ticket", ticket_));
    return grpc::Status::OK;
  }

 private:
  grpc::string ticket_;
};

auto call_creds = grpc::MetadataCredentialsFromPlugin(
    std::unique_ptr<grpc::MetadataCredentialsPlugin>(
        new MyCustomAuthenticator("super-secret-ticket")));
```

A deeper integration can be achieved by plugging in a gRPC credentials
implementation at the core level. gRPC internals also allow switching out
SSL/TLS with other encryption mechanisms.

## Examples

These authentication mechanisms will be available in all gRPC's supported
languages. The following sections demonstrate how authentication and
authorization features described above appear in each language: more languages
are coming soon.

### Ruby

#### Base case - no encryption or authentication

```ruby

stub = Helloworld::Greeter::Stub.new('localhost:50051', :this_channel_is_insecure)
...
```

#### With server authentication SSL/TLS

```ruby
creds = GRPC::Core::Credentials.new(load_certs)  # load_certs typically loads a CA roots file
stub = Helloworld::Greeter::Stub.new('myservice.example.com', creds)
```

#### Authenticate with Google

```ruby
require 'googleauth'  # from http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/googleauth/0.1.0
...
ssl_creds = GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials.new(load_certs)  # load_certs typically loads a CA roots file
authentication = Google::Auth.get_application_default()
call_creds = GRPC::Core::CallCredentials.new(authentication.updater_proc)
combined_creds = ssl_creds.compose(call_creds)
stub = Helloworld::Greeter::Stub.new('greeter.googleapis.com', combined_creds)
```

### C++

#### Base case - no encryption or authentication
```cpp
auto channel = grpc::CreateChannel("localhost:50051", InsecureChannelCredentials());
std::unique_ptr<Greeter::Stub> stub(Greeter::NewStub(channel));
...
```

#### With server authentication SSL/TLS

```cpp
auto channel_creds = grpc::SslCredentials(grpc::SslCredentialsOptions());
auto channel = grpc::CreateChannel("myservice.example.com", creds);
std::unique_ptr<Greeter::Stub> stub(Greeter::NewStub(channel));
...
```

#### Authenticate with Google

```cpp
auto creds = grpc::GoogleDefaultCredentials();
auto channel = grpc::CreateChannel("greeter.googleapis.com", creds);
std::unique_ptr<Greeter::Stub> stub(Greeter::NewStub(channel));
...
```

### C&#35;

#### Base case - no encryption or authentication

```csharp
var channel = new Channel("localhost:50051", ChannelCredentials.Insecure);
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);
...
```

#### With server authentication SSL/TLS

```csharp
var channelCredentials = new SslCredentials(File.ReadAllText("roots.pem"));  // Load a custom roots file.
var channel = new Channel("myservice.example.com", channelCredentials);
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);
```

#### Authenticate with Google


```csharp
using Grpc.Auth;  // from Grpc.Auth NuGet package
...
// Loads Google Application Default Credentials with publicly trusted roots.
var channelCredentials = await GoogleGrpcCredentials.GetApplicationDefaultAsync();

var channel = new Channel("greeter.googleapis.com", channelCredentials);
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);
...
```

#### Authenticate a single RPC call

```csharp
var channel = new Channel("greeter.googleapis.com", new SslCredentials());  // Use publicly trusted roots.
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);
...
var googleCredential = await GoogleCredential.GetApplicationDefaultAsync();
var result = client.SayHello(request, new CallOptions(credentials: googleCredential.ToCallCredentials()));
...

```

### Python

#### Base case - No encryption or authentication

```python
import grpc
import helloworld_pb2

channel = grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051')
stub = helloworld_pb2.GreeterStub(channel)
```

#### With server authentication SSL/TLS

```python
import grpc
import helloworld_pb2

creds = grpc.ssl_channel_credentials(open('roots.pem').read())
channel = grpc.secure_channel('myservice.example.com:443', creds)
stub = helloworld_pb2.GreeterStub(channel)
```

#### Authenticate with Google

```python
import grpc
import helloworld_pb2
from oauth2client import client

transport_creds = grpc.ssl_channel_credentials(open('roots.pem').read())
credentials = client.GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
scoped_credentials = credentials.create_scoped([scope])
def oauth2token_credentials(context, callback):
  callback([('authorization', 'Bearer %s' % scoped_credentials.get_access_token().access_token)], None)

auth_creds = grpc.metadata_call_credentials(oauth2token_credentials)
channel_creds = grpc.composite_channel_credentials(transport_creds, auth_creds)
channel = grpc.secure_channel('greeter.googleapis.com:443', channel_creds)
stub = helloworld_pb2.GreeterStub(channel)
```

### Java

#### Base case - no encryption or authentication

```java
ManagedChannel channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress("localhost", 50051)
    .usePlaintext(true)
    .build();
GreeterGrpc.GreeterStub stub = GreeterGrpc.newStub(channel);

```

#### With server authentication SSL/TLS

In Java we recommend that you use OpenSSL when using gRPC over TLS. You can find
details about installing and using OpenSSL and other required libraries for both
Android and non-Android Java in the gRPC Java
[Security](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/SECURITY.md#transport-security-tls)
documentation.

To enable TLS on a server, a certificate chain and private key need to be
specified in PEM format. The standard TLS port is 443, but we use 8443 below to
avoid needing extra permissions from the OS.

```java
Server server = ServerBuilder.forPort(8443)
    // Enable TLS
    .useTransportSecurity(certChainFile, privateKeyFile)
    .addService(TestServiceGrpc.bindService(serviceImplementation))
    .build();
server.start();
```

If the issuing certificate authority is not known to the client then a properly
configured `SslContext` or `SSLSocketFactory` should be provided to the
`NettyChannelBuilder` or `OkHttpChannelBuilder`, respectively.

On the client side, server authentication with SSL/TLS looks like this:

```java
// With server authentication SSL/TLS
ManagedChannel channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress("myservice.example.com", 443)
    .build();
GreeterGrpc.GreeterStub stub = GreeterGrpc.newStub(channel);

// With server authentication SSL/TLS; custom CA root certificates; not on Android
ManagedChannel channel = NettyChannelBuilder.forAddress("myservice.example.com", 443)
    .sslContext(GrpcSslContexts.forClient().trustManager(new File("roots.pem")).build())
    .build();
GreeterGrpc.GreeterStub stub = GreeterGrpc.newStub(channel);
```

#### Authenticate with Google

The following code snippet shows how you can call the [Google Cloud PubSub
API](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/overview) using gRPC with a service
account. The credentials are loaded from a key stored in a well-known location
or by detecting that the application is running in an environment that can
provide one automatically, e.g. Google Compute Engine. While this example is
specific to Google and its services, similar patterns can be followed for other
service providers.

```java
GoogleCredentials creds = GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault();
ManagedChannel channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forTarget("greeter.googleapis.com")
    .build();
GreeterGrpc.GreeterStub stub = GreeterGrpc.newStub(channel)
    .withCallCredentials(MoreCallCredentials.from(creds));
```

### Node.js

#### Base case - No encryption/authentication

```js
var stub = new helloworld.Greeter('localhost:50051', grpc.credentials.createInsecure());
```

#### With server authentication SSL/TLS

```js
var ssl_creds = grpc.credentials.createSsl(root_certs);
var stub = new helloworld.Greeter('myservice.example.com', ssl_creds);
```

#### Authenticate with Google

```js
// Authenticating with Google
var GoogleAuth = require('google-auth-library'); // from https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-auth-library
...
var ssl_creds = grpc.credentials.createSsl(root_certs);
(new GoogleAuth()).getApplicationDefault(function(err, auth) {
  var call_creds = grpc.credentials.createFromGoogleCredential(auth);
  var combined_creds = grpc.credentials.combineChannelCredentials(ssl_creds, call_creds);
  var stub = new helloworld.Greeter('greeter.googleapis.com', combined_credentials);
});
```

#### Authenticate with Google using Oauth2 token (legacy approach)

```js
var GoogleAuth = require('google-auth-library'); // from https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-auth-library
...
var ssl_creds = grpc.Credentials.createSsl(root_certs); // load_certs typically loads a CA roots file
var scope = 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/grpc-testing';
(new GoogleAuth()).getApplicationDefault(function(err, auth) {
  if (auth.createScopeRequired()) {
    auth = auth.createScoped(scope);
  }
  var call_creds = grpc.credentials.createFromGoogleCredential(auth);
  var combined_creds = grpc.credentials.combineChannelCredentials(ssl_creds, call_creds);
  var stub = new helloworld.Greeter('greeter.googleapis.com', combined_credentials);
});
```

### PHP

#### Base case - No encryption/authorization

```php
$client = new helloworld\GreeterClient('localhost:50051', [
    'credentials' => Grpc\ChannelCredentials::createInsecure(),
]);
...
```

#### Authenticate with Google

```php
function updateAuthMetadataCallback($context)
{
    $auth_credentials = ApplicationDefaultCredentials::getCredentials();
    return $auth_credentials->updateMetadata($metadata = [], $context->service_url);
}
$channel_credentials = Grpc\ChannelCredentials::createComposite(
    Grpc\ChannelCredentials::createSsl(file_get_contents('roots.pem')),
    Grpc\CallCredentials::createFromPlugin('updateAuthMetadataCallback')
);
$opts = [
  'credentials' => $channel_credentials
];
$client = new helloworld\GreeterClient('greeter.googleapis.com', $opts);
````

#### Authenticate with Google using Oauth2 token (legacy approach)

```php
// the environment variable "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS" needs to be set
$scope = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/grpc-testing";
$auth = Google\Auth\ApplicationDefaultCredentials::getCredentials($scope);
$opts = [
  'credentials' => Grpc\Credentials::createSsl(file_get_contents('roots.pem'));
  'update_metadata' => $auth->getUpdateMetadataFunc(),
];
$client = new helloworld\GreeterClient('greeter.googleapis.com', $opts);
```
