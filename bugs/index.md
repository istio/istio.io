# Bugs!

Oh no! You found a bug? Here's what you need to do:

1. Check out the [troubleshooting guide]({{home}}/troubleshooting) for solutions to common problems.

2. Check out the [istio-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/istio-users) group mailing list. You can easily search to
see if someone else has already encountered the problem. Maybe there's a simple workaround you can use until the bug has been fixed.

3. If you didn't find any info on istio-users about your problem, file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/istio/istio.github.io/issues/new) so
the development team is made aware of the problem and can get it fixed.
