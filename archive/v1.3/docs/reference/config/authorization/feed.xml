A ServiceRole specification includes a list of rules (permissions). Each rule has the following standard fields:
services: a list of services. methods: A list of HTTP methods. You can set the value to * to include all HTTP methods. This field should not be set for TCP services. The policy will be ignored. For gRPC services, only POST is allowed; other methods will result in denying services.</description></item></channel></rss>
