		    Istio is an open platform that provides a uniform way to connect, manage,
		    and secure microservices. Istio supports managing traffic flows between
		    microservices, enforcing access policies, and aggregating telemetry data,
		    all without requiring changes to the microservice code.
		  </p>
		  <p class="about-max lead">
		    Istio gives you:
		    <ul>
		      <li>Automatic metrics, logs, and traces for all traffic within a cluster,
			including cluster ingress and egress.</li>
		      <li>Fine-grained control of traffic behavior with rich routing rules,
			retries, failovers, and fault injection.</li>
		      <li>Automatic service discovery and load balancing for HTTP, GRPC, and
			TCP traffic.</li>
		      <li>Secure service-to-service authentication with strong identity assertions
			between services in a cluster.</li>
		      <li>A pluggable policy layer and configuration API supporting access controls,
			rate limits and quotas.</li>
		    </ul>
		  </p>
		  <p class="about-max lead">
		    Istio currently only supports the Kubernetes platform, although we plan support
		    for additional platforms such as CloudFoundry, Mesos, and bare metal in the near future.
