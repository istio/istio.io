                    As enterprises migrate from traditional VM infrastructures to more agile
                    microservice-based deployments on container platforms, there is a need for
                    a simplifying technology that can take care of common cross-cutting
                    capabilities around service communication and management such as secure
                    interconnect, service discovery & load balancing, staged rollouts, A/B
                    testing, intelligent rate limiting, authentication, access control,
                    monitoring, logging, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-max lead">
                    Towards this goal, we are designing Istio, an <i>open
                    platform-independent service mesh</i> that takes care of traffic management,
                    policy enforcement, rate limiting, and telemetry collection.
                    It allows application developers to focus on the
                    business logic and iterate quickly on new features by managing how traffic
                    flows across their services. And it simplifies the operators' job of enforcing
                    various policies and monitor the mesh from a central control point,
                    independent of the evolution of the application ensuring continuous
                    compliance with policies of the organization/business unit.
