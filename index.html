            <p>Istio is a content and version-based routing fabric for
            integrating polyglot microservices. Its control plane APIs can
            be used to dynamically program rules for routing and manipulating
            requests across microservices in a running application.

            <h3 class="landing-row-title">Why Use Istio?</h3>

            <div class="section__row">
            <div>
                <p>The ability to route requests in a content/version-aware manner simplifies DevOps tasks such as canary and
                red/black deployments, A/B testing, and systematically testing resilience of microservices.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>You can use the Istio platform with popular container runtimes like Docker, Kubernetes, Marathon/ Mesos, or your favorite cloud provider such as IBM Bluemix, Google Cloud Platform, or Amazon AWS.</p>

            <h3 class="landing-row-title">How It Works</h3>
            <p>Istio is composed of these three components:</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Registry</h3>
                <p>A high performance multi-tenant service registry that provides a centralized view of all the microservices in an application regardless of where they are all actually running.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Controller</h3>
                <p>A multi-tenant controller that provides APIs to the developer
                for configuring rules for request routing, fault injection,
                etc. These rules are then translated and sent to the sidecars
                attached to various microservices.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Sidecar</h3>
                <p>Applications run as tenants of the Istio Control Plane. A sidecar
                process automatically registers the microservice with the registry.
                It receives instance information from the registry and routing rules from the controller. The sidecar configures the nginx proxy based on the routing rules.</p>
